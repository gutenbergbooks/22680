<p>In order to avoid any misconception, the Publishers
think it advisable to announce that the present
Edition of the "Biglow Papers" is issued with the
express sanction of the Author, granted by letter,
from which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date1">"<span class="smcap">Cambridge, Massachusetts</span>,<br />
<i>14th September, 1859</i>.</p>

<p>"I think it would be well for you to announce that you are
to publish an Authorized Edition of the '<span class="smcap">Biglow Papers</span>;'
for I have just received a letter from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who tells me
that a Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was thinking of an edition, and wished him
to edit it. Any such undertaking will be entirely against my
will, and I take it for granted that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; only formed the
plan in ignorance of your intention.</p>

<h2><a name="ENGLISH_EDITORS_PREFACE" id="ENGLISH_EDITORS_PREFACE"></a>ENGLISH EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>I can safely say that few things in my life have
pleased me more than the request of Messrs. Tr&uuml;bner,
backed by the expressed wish of the author, that I
would see the first English edition of the "Biglow
Papers" through the press. I fell in with the Papers
about ten years ago, soon after their publication; and
the impression they then made on me has been deepening
and becoming more lively ever since. In fact, I
do not think that, even in his own New England, Mr.
Lowell can have a more constant or more grateful
reader, though I cannot say that I go much beyond
most of my own intimate friends over here in my love
for his works. I may remark, in passing, that the
impossibility of keeping a copy of the "Biglow Papers"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
for more than a few weeks (of which many of us have
had repeated and sorrowful proof<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) shows how much
an English Edition is needed.</p>

<p>Perhaps, strictly speaking, I should say a reprint,
and not an edition. In fact, I am not clear (in spite
of the wishes of author and publishers) that I have
any right to call myself editor, for the book is as
thoroughly edited already as a book need be. What
between dear old Parson Wilbur&mdash;with his little
vanities and pedantries, his "infinite faculty of
sermonizing," his simplicity and humour, and his deep
and righteous views of life, and power of hard hitting
when he has anything to say which needs driving
home&mdash;and Father Ezekiel, "the brown parchment-hided
old man of the geoponic or bucolic species,"
"76 year old cum next tater diggin, and thair aint
nowheres a kitting" (we readily believe) "spryer 'n
he be;" and that judicious and lazy sub-editor, "Columbus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Nye, pastor of a church in Bungtown Corner,"
whose acquaintance we make so thoroughly in the ten
lines which he contributes&mdash;whatever of setting or
framing was needed, or indeed possible, for the nine
gems in verse of Mr. Hosea Biglow, has been so well
done already in America by the hand best fitted for
the task, that he must be a bold man who would
meddle with the book now in the editing way. Even
the humble satisfaction of adding a glossary and index
has been denied to me, as there are already very good
ones. I have merely added some half-dozen words to
the glossary, at which I thought that English readers
might perhaps stumble. When the proposal was first
made to me, indeed, I thought of trying my hand at a
sketch of American politics of thirteen years ago, the
date of the Mexican war and of the first appearance of
the "Biglow Papers." But I soon found out, first,
that I was not, and had no ready means of making
myself, competent for such a task; secondly, that the
book did not need it. The very slight knowledge which
every educated Englishman has of Transatlantic politics
will be quite enough to make him enjoy the racy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
smack of the American soil, which is one of their
great charms; and, as to the particular characters,
they are most truly citizens of the world as well as
Americans. If an Englishman cannot find 'Bird-o'-freedom
Sawins,' 'John P. Robinson's,' 'pious editors,' and
candidates "facin' south-by-north" at home&mdash;ay, and
if he is not conscious of his own individual propensity
to the meannesses and duplicities of such, which come
under the lash of Hosea&mdash;he knows little of the land
we live in, or of his own heart, and is not worthy to
read the "Biglow Papers."</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of any attempt of my own, I will
give Mr. Lowell's own account of how and why he
came to write this book. "All I can say is," he writes,
"the book was <i>thar</i>. How it came is more than I can
tell. I cannot, like the great G&ouml;the, deliberately
imagine what would have been a proper 'Entstehungsweise'
for my book, and then assume it as
fact. I only know that I believed our war with
Mexico (though we had as just ground for it as a
strong nation ever had against a weak one) to be
essentially a war of false pretences, and that it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
result in widening the boundaries, and so prolonging
the life of slavery. Believing that it is the manifest
destiny of the English race to occupy this whole continent,
and to display there that practical understanding
in matters of government and colonization
which no other race has given such proofs of possessing
since the Romans, I hated to see a noble hope
evaporated into a lying phrase to sweeten the foul
breath of demagogues. Leaving the sin of it to God,
I believed, and still believe, that slavery is the
Achilles-heel of our own polity, that it is a temporary
and false supremacy of the white races, sure to
destroy that supremacy at last, because an enslaved
people always prove themselves of more enduring
fibre than their enslavers, as not suffering from the
social vices sure to be engendered by oppression in
the governing class. Against these and many other
things I thought all honest men should protest. I
was born and bred in the country, and the dialect
was homely to me. I tried my first Biglow paper in
a newspaper, and found that it had a great run. So
I wrote the others from time to time during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
year which followed, always very rapidly, and sometimes
(as with 'What Mr. Robinson thinks') at one
sitting. When I came to collect them and publish
them in a volume, I conceived my parson-editor, with
his pedantry and verbosity, his amiable vanity and
superiority to the verses he was editing, as a fitting
artistic background and foil. He gave me the
chance, too, of glancing obliquely at many things
which were beyond the horizon of my other characters."</p>

<p>There are two American books, elder brethren of
"The Biglow Papers," which it would be unjust in
an Englishman not to mention while introducing
their big younger brother to his own countrymen,&mdash;I
mean, of course, "Major Downing's Letters," and
"Sam Slick;" both of which are full of rare humour,
and treat of the most exciting political questions of
their day in a method and from points of view of
which we are often reminded while reading the
"Biglow Papers." In fact, Mr. Lowell borrows his
name from the Major's Letters;&mdash;"Zekel Bigelow,
Broker and Banker of Wall Street, New York," is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
the friend who corrects the spelling, and certifies to
the genuineness, of the honest Major's effusions,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
is one of the raciest characters in the book. No one,
I am sure, would be so ready as Mr. Lowell to acknowledge
whatever obligations he may have to other
men, and no one can do it more safely. For though
he may owe a name or an idea to others, he seems
to me to stand quite alone amongst Americans, and
to be the only one who is beyond question entitled
to take his place in the first rank, by the side of
the great political satirists of ancient and modern
Europe.</p>

<p>Greece had her Aristophanes; Rome her Juvenal;
Spain has had her Cervantes; France her Rabelais, her
Moli&egrave;re, her Voltaire; Germany her Jean Paul, her
Heine; England her Swift, her Thackeray; and America
has her Lowell. By the side of all those great masters
of satire, though kept somewhat in the rear by provincialism
of style and subject, the author of the
"Biglow Papers" holds his own place distinct from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
each and all. The man who reads the book for the
first time, and is capable of understanding it, has
received a new sensation. In Lowell the American
mind has for the first time flowered out into thoroughly
original genius.</p>

<p>There is an airy grace about the best pieces of
Washington Irving, which has no parallel amongst
English writers, however closely modelled may be his
style upon that of the Addisonian age. There is
much original power, which will perhaps be better
appreciated at a future day, about Fenimore Cooper's
delineations of the physical and spiritual border-land,
between white and red, between civilization and
savagery. There is dramatic power of a high order
about Mr. Hawthorne, though mixed with a certain
morbidness and bad taste, which debar him from ever
attaining to the first rank. There is an originality of
position about Mr. Emerson, in his resolute setting
up of King Self against King Mob, which, coupled
with a singular metallic glitter of style, and plenty
of shrewd New England mother-wit, have made up
together one of the best counterfeits of genius that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
has been seen for many a day; so good, indeed,
that most men are taken by it for the first quarter
of an hour at the least. But for real unmistakable
genius,&mdash;for that glorious fulness of power which
knocks a man down at a blow for sheer admiration,
and then makes him rush into the arms of the
knocker-down, and swear eternal friendship with him
for sheer delight; the "Biglow Papers" stand alone.</p>

<p>If I sought to describe their characteristics, I should
say, the most exuberant and extravagant humour,
coupled with strong, noble, Christian purpose,&mdash;a
thorough scorn for all that is false and base, all the
more withering because of the thorough geniality of
the writer. Perhaps Jean Paul is of all the satirists
I have named the one who at bottom presents most
affinity with Lowell, but the differences are marked.
The intellectual sphere of the German is vaster, but
though with certain aims before him, he rather floats
and tumbles about like a porpoise at play than follows
any direct perceptible course. With Lowell, on the
contrary, every word tells, every laugh is a blow; as
if the god Momus had turned out as Mars, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
hard at work fighting every inch of him, grinning his
broadest all the while.</p>

<p>Will some English readers be shocked by this combination
of broad and keen humour with high Christian
purpose&mdash;the association of humour and Christianity?
I hope not. At any rate, I would remind any such
of Luther, and of our own Latimer and Rowland Hill;
are they prepared to condemn them and many more
like them? Nay (though it is a question which can
only be hinted at here), does not the Bible itself sanction
the combination by its own example? Is there
not humour mixed with the tremendous sarcasm of
the old prophets&mdash;dread humour no doubt, but humour
unmistakably&mdash;wherever they speak of the helplessness
of idols, as in the forty-fourth and forty-sixth chapters
of Isaiah, and in Elijah's mockery of the priests of
Baal:&mdash;"Cry aloud, for he is a God; either he is
talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, or
peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awakened." Is
not the book of Proverbs full of grave, dry, pungent
humour? Consider only the following passage out of
many of the same spirit: "As the door turneth upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. The
slothful hideth his hand in his bosom, it grieveth
him to bring it again to his mouth. The sluggard
is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can
render a reason. He that passeth by and meddleth
with strife belonging not to him, is like one that
taketh a dog by the ears."&mdash;Prov. xxvi. 14-17.</p>

<p>Or if it be objected that these things belong to an
earlier covenant, that laughter and jesting are "not
convenient" under the Gospel of Him who came not
to destroy the law but to fulfil it, there is, perhaps, an
answer to this also.</p>

<p>For a specimen of subdued humour in narrative,
adhering in the most literal manner to facts, and yet
contriving to bring them out by that graphic literalness
under their most ludicrous aspect, what can
equal St. Luke's description of the riot at Ephesus?
The picture of the narrow trade selfishness of Demetrius&mdash;of
polytheism reduced into a matter of business&mdash;of
the inanity of a mob tumult in an enslaved
country&mdash;of the mixed coaxing and bullying of its
officials, was surely never brought out with a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
latter vice, indeed, includes both the others, or rather
uses them as its instruments. Thus, the "pious
Editor" proclaims, as his creed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I du believe in Freedom's cause<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ez fur away ez Paris is;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love to see her stick her claws<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In them infarnal Pharisees;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To dror resolves and triggers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But libbaty's a kind o' thing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thet don't agree with niggers.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No doubt they go further than this. I am quite
aware that Mr. Lowell will be claimed as a champion
by the peace party in this country; and certainly no
keener things have been said against war in general
than are to be found in this book.</p>

<p>With our own peace-at-any-price party, no one has
less sympathy than I; and this leads me to urge on
all English readers to bear in mind, that the "Biglow
Papers" were written for a New England audience, by
a New Englander, and must be judged from a New
England point of view. The citizen of a huge young
mammoth country, divided by a whole ocean from the
nearest enemy that it could fear, assailable only on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
vivid sense of the absurdity of the whole. "And
Gallio cared for none of these things," is another
touch of quiet humour, which at once brings out
the ludicrous aspect of the punishment of the Jewish
agitators by means of the very tumults which they
raised.</p>

<p>I take it, therefore, that the exhibition of humour,
in the pursuit, and as an aid for the attainment of a
noble Christian purpose, is a means of action not only
sanctioned by the very constitution of our natures (in
which God has implanted so deeply the sense of the
ludicrous, surely not that we might root it out) but,
by the very example of Holy Writ. The humour exhibited
may be different in degree and in quality; the
skies of Syria are not those of Germany, or of Spain,
of England, whether old or new. But the gift in
itself is a pure and precious one, if lawfully and rightfully
used.</p>

<p>Military braggadocio, political and literary humbug,
and slave-holding, are the three great butts at which
Hosea Biglow and Parson Wilbur shoot, at point-blank
range, and with shafts drawn well to the ear. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
fringe of its seaboard (itself consisting chiefly of unapproachable
swamp or barren sand wastes), surrounded
by weak neighbours or thin wandering hordes, only too
easy to bully, to subdue, to eat up; from which bands
of pirates, under the name of liberators, swarm forth
year after year, almost unchecked, to neighbouring
lands, and to which if defeated they only return to be
caressed and applauded by their congeners; where
the getting up of war-fevers forms part of the stock in
trade of too many of the leading politicians; where in
particular the grasping at new territories for slave
labour, by means however foul, has become the special
and avowed policy of the slavery party; the citizen of
such a country has a right to tell his countrymen
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'T'aint your eppyletts an' feathers<br /></span>

<span class="i2">God 'll send the bill to you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the bravest officer in Her Majesty's service will
laugh as heartily as you will, I take it, my dear reader,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
if you have never heard it before, over a picture and a
contrast such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Parson Wilbur sez, <i>he</i> never heerd in his life<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thet th' Apostles rigged out in their swaller-tail coats,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Robinson he<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sez they didnt know everythin' down in Juddee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But England is a small and wealthy country, whose
best defence against a neighbour, always likely to become
a foe, consists in a mere ocean canal; where the
question, I will not say of war, but of readiness for war,
is one of life or death&mdash;in which the temptation, always
so strong, to subordinate national honour to what is
supposed to be policy, is in our day for most statesmen
almost irresistible, because political influence is so
evenly balanced, that a peace party of perhaps twenty
votes has often the destinies of a ministry in its hands.
Had Mr. Lowell been an Englishman, no one who
knows his writings can believe for a moment that he
would have swelled the cry or strengthened the hands
of the vain and mischievous clique, who amongst us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
have of late years raised the cry of peace when there is
no peace.</p>

<p>The same caution will apply to our marked peculiarity
of style in the book, which may offend at first
many persons otherwise most capable of entering into
its spirit. I mean the constant, and so to speak, pervading
use of Scripture language and incidents, not
only side by side with the most grotesque effusions of
humour, but as one main element of the ludicrous
effects produced. This undoubtedly would be as really
offensive as it would be untrue, from any other point
of view perhaps than that of a New Englander bred in
the country. The rural population of New England is
still, happily for itself, tinctured in all its language,
habits, modes of feeling and thought, by a strict Scriptural
training&mdash;"Out of the fulness of the heart the
mouth speaketh." Look below the surface and you
will see that there is no irreverence whatever beneath
Hosea Biglow's daring use of Scripture; only that "perfect
love which casteth out fear;" that the very purpose
of the whole book is to set up Christ's Gospel as <i>the</i>
standard by which alone all men are to be judged in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
all their acts. We may disagree from him in the conclusions
which he draws from Scripture; of his earnest
sincerity in enforcing those conclusions we cannot
doubt.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory, indeed, to think that Mr. Lowell's
shafts have already, in a great measure, ceased to be
required, or would have to be aimed now at other
bull's eyes. The servility of the Northern States to the
South, which twelve years ago so raised his indignation,
has well nigh ceased to be. The vital importance of
the slavery question is now thoroughly recognized by
the great republican party, which I trust is year by
year advancing towards an assured victory.</p>

<p>For that victory Mr. Lowell has done knight's-service
by his other works, as well as by the
"Biglow Papers." I need not do more than refer
to these, however, as they have been published in
a cheap form over here, and I believe have circulated
largely. In his other poems he is by no means so
equal as in the "Biglow Papers;" but I cannot
help thinking that (leaving out of sight altogether
his satirical works) fifty years hence he will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
recognized as the greatest American poet of our day,
notwithstanding the contemporary judgment which
has in England, and I believe in America, assigned
that proud place to his friend and predecessor at
Harvard College, H. W. Longfellow. To any reader
who has not met with Lowell's Poems, and who
may be induced to read them after a perusal of
the present volume, I should recommend "The
Vision of Sir Launfal," "A Parable," "Stanzas on
Freedom," "The Present Crisis," and "Hunger and
Cold," as specially fit to be read in connexion with
the "Biglow Papers." It is only by looking at all
sides of a man of this mould that you can get a
notion of his size and power. Readers, therefore,
should search out for themselves the exquisite little
gems of a lighter kind, which lie about in the other
poems comprised in the volume. I am only indicating
those which, as it seems to me, when taken
with the "Biglow Papers," give the best idea of
the man, and what his purpose in life has been,
and is.</p>

<p>I will not think so badly of my countrymen as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
suppose for a moment that "The Biglow Papers" will
not become the intimate friends of all good fellows in
England; and when we have really made friends with
a book, we like to know something about our friend's
father; so I shall add the little I know of the history
of James Russell Lowell.</p>

<p>He was born in 1819, at Cambridge, Massachusetts,
so that he is some years younger than our own laureate,
and we may hope to get out of him many another
noble work, though we shall get no more "Biglow
Papers"&mdash;at least I fear not; for the sort of inspiration
which finds voice in this way comes, I take it, only
once in a man's life. And moreover, this is his own
conviction. In a letter which I received from him as
to the present publication, he writes: "Friendly people
say to me sometimes, 'Write us more "Biglow Papers;"'
and I have even been simple enough to try, only to
find that I could not. This has helped to persuade me
that the book was a genuine growth, and not a manufacture,
and that therefore I had an honest right to be
pleased without blushing, if people liked it." He was
educated at Harvard College, Cambridge; and, in fact,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
has never lived away from his native place. He read
law, but never practised; and in 1855 was chosen to
succeed Longfellow as Professor of Modern Literature
in Harvard College. He has visited Europe twice;
and I am sure that every one who knows his works
must join with me in the hearty wish that he may
come among us again as soon as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTICES_OF_AN_INDEPENDENT_PRESS" id="NOTICES_OF_AN_INDEPENDENT_PRESS"></a>NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS.</h2>


<div class="hw"><p>[I have observed, reader, (bene- or male-volent, as it may
happen,) that it is customary to append to the second editions
of books, and to the second works of authors, short sentences
commendatory of the first, under the title of <i>Notices of the
Press</i>. These, I have been given to understand, are procurable
at certain established rates, payment being made either in
money or advertising patronage by the publisher, or by an
adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author. Considering
these things with myself, and also that such notices
are neither intended, nor generally believed, to convey any real
opinions, being a purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature,
and resembling certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal
panaceas, I conceived that it would be not only more
economical to prepare a sufficient number of such myself, but
also more immediately subservient to the end in view, to prefix
them to this our primary edition, rather than await the contingency
of a second, when they would seem to be of small
utility. To delay attaching the <i>bobs</i> until the second attempt
at flying the kite would indicate but a slender experience in
that useful art. Neither has it escaped my notice, nor failed
to afford me matter of reflection, that, when a circus or a caravan
is about to visit Jaalam, the initial step is to send forward
large and highly ornamented bills of performance to be hung in
the bar-room and the post-office. These having been sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
gazed at, and beginning to lose their attractiveness
except for the flies, and, truly, the boys also, (in whom I find
it impossible to repress, even during school-hours, certain oral
and telegraphic correspondences concerning the expected show,)
upon some fine morning the band enters in a gaily-painted
waggon, or triumphal chariot, and with noisy advertisement,
by means of brass, wood, and sheepskin, makes the circuit of
our startled village-streets. Then, as the exciting sounds draw
nearer and nearer, do I desiderate those eyes of Aristarchus,
"whose looks were as a breeching to a boy." Then do I
perceive, with vain regret of wasted opportunities, the advantage
of a pancratic or pantechnic education, since he is most
reverenced by my little subjects who can throw the cleanest
summerset, or walk most securely upon the revolving cask.
The story of the Pied Piper becomes for the first time credible
to me, (albeit confirmed by the Hameliners dating their legal
instruments from the period of his exit,) as I behold how those
strains, without pretence of magical potency, bewitch the pupillary
legs, nor leave to the pedagogic an entire self-control.
For these reasons, lest my kingly prerogative should suffer
diminution, I prorogue my restless commons, whom I also
follow into the street, chiefly lest some mischief may chance
befall them. After the manner of such a band, I send forward
the following notices of domestic manufacture, to make brazen
proclamation, not unconscious of the advantage which will
accrue, if our little craft, <i>cymbula sutilis</i>, shall seem to leave
port with a clipping breeze, and to carry, in nautical phrase,
a bone in her mouth. Nevertheless, I have chosen, as being
more equitable, to prepare some also sufficiently objurgatory,
that readers of every taste may find a dish to their palate. I
have modelled them upon actually existing specimens, preserved
in my own cabinet of natural curiosities. One, in particular,
I had copied with tolerable exactness from a notice of one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
my own discourses, which, from its superior tone and appearance
of vast experience, I concluded to have been written by
a man at least three hundred years of age, though I recollected
no existing instance of such antediluvian longevity. Nevertheless,
I afterwards discovered the author to be a young
gentleman preparing for the ministry under the direction of one
of my brethren in a neighbouring town, and whom I had once
instinctively corrected in a Latin quantity. But this I have
been forced to omit, from its too great length.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>From the Universal Littery Universe.</i></p>

<p>Full of passages which rivet the attention of the reader.... Under a
rustic garb, sentiments are conveyed which should be committed to the
memory and engraven on the heart of every moral and social being....
We consider this a <i>unique</i> performance.... We hope to see it soon introduced
into our common schools.... Mr. Wilbur has performed his
duties as editor with excellent taste and judgment.... This is a vein
which we hope to see successfully prosecuted.... We hail the appearance
of this work as a long stride toward the formation of a purely aboriginal,
indigenous, native, and American literature. We rejoice to meet with an
author national enough to break away from the slavish deference, too
common among us, to English grammar and orthography.... Where all
is so good, we are at a loss how to make extracts.... On the whole, we
may call it a volume which no library, pretending to entire completeness,
should fail to place upon its shelves.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the Higginbottomopolis Snapping-turtle.</i></p>

<p>A collection of the merest balderdash and doggerel that it was ever our
bad fortune to lay eyes on. The author is a vulgar buffoon, and the editor
a talkative, tedious old fool. We use strong language, but should any of
our readers peruse the book, (from which calamity Heaven preserve them,)
they will find reasons for it thick as the leaves of Vallumbrozer, or, to use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
a still more expressive comparison, as the combined heads of author and
editor. The work is wretchedly got up.... We should like to know how
much <i>British gold</i> was pocketed by this libeller of our country and her
purest patriots.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the Oldfogrumville Mentor.</i></p>

<p>We have not had time to do more than glance through this handsomely
printed volume, but the name of its respectable editor, the Rev. Mr.
Wilbur, of Jaalam, will afford a sufficient guaranty for the worth of its
contents.... The paper is white, the type clear, and the volume of a convenient
and attractive size.... In reading this elegantly executed work,
it has seemed to us that a passage or two might have been retrenched with
advantage, and that the general style of diction was susceptible of a higher
polish.... On the whole, we may safely leave the ungrateful task of
criticism to the reader. We will barely suggest, that in volumes intended,
as this is, for the illustration of a provincial dialect and turns of expression,
a dash of humour or satire might be thrown in with advantage....
The work is admirably got up.... This work will form an appropriate
ornament to the centre-table. It is beautifully printed, on paper of an
excellent quality.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the Dekay Bulwark.</i></p>

<p>We should be wanting in our duty as the conductor of that tremendous
engine, a public press, as an American, and as a man, did we allow such
an opportunity as is presented to us by "The Biglow Papers" to pass by
without entering our earnest protest against such attempts (now, alas! too
common) at demoralizing the public sentiment. Under a wretched mask
of stupid drollery, slavery, war, the social glass, and, in short, all the
valuable and time-honoured institutions justly dear to our common
humanity and especially to republicans, are made the butt of coarse and
senseless ribaldry by this low-minded scribbler. It is time that the respectable
and religious portion of our community should be aroused to the
alarming inroads of foreign Jacobinism, sansculottism, and infidelity. It
is a fearful proof of the wide-spread nature of this contagion, that these
secret stabs at religion and virtue are given from under the cloak (<i>credite,
posteri!</i>) of a clergyman. It is a mournful spectacle indeed to the patriot
and Christian to see liberality and new ideas (falsely so called,&mdash;they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
as old as Eden) invading the sacred precincts of the pulpit.... On the
whole, we consider this volume as one of the first shocking results which
we predicted would spring out of the late French "Revolution"(!).</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the Bungtown Copper and Comprehensive Tocsin (a tryweakly
family journal).</i></p>

<p>Altogether an admirable work.... Full of humour, boisterous, but
delicate,&mdash;of wit withering and scorching, yet combined with a pathos
cool as morning dew,&mdash;of satire ponderous as the mace of Richard, yet
keen as the scymitar of Saladin.... A work full of "mountain-mirth,"
mischievous as Puck and lightsome as Ariel.... We know not whether
to admire most the genial, fresh, and discursive concinnity of the author,
or his playful fancy, weird imagination, and compass of style, at once both
objective and subjective.... We might indulge in some criticisms, but,
were the author other than he is, he would be a different being. As it is,
he has a wonderful <i>pose</i>, which flits from flower to flower, and bears the
reader irresistibly along on its eagle pinions (like Ganymede) to the
"highest heaven of invention." ... We love a book so purely objective....
Many of his pictures of natural scenery have an extraordinary subjective
clearness and fidelity.... In fine, we consider this as one of the
most extraordinary volumes of this or any age. We know of no English
author who could have written it. It is a work to which the proud genius
of our country, standing with one foot on the Aroostook and the other on
the Rio Grande, and holding up the star-spangled banner amid the wreck
of matter and the crush of worlds, may point with bewildering scorn of
the punier efforts of enslaved Europe.... We hope soon to encounter
our author among those higher walks of literature in which he is evidently
capable of achieving enduring fame. Already we should be inclined to
assign him a high position in the bright galaxy of our American bards.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the Saltriver Pilot and Flag of Freedom.</i></p>

<p>A volume in bad grammar and worse taste.... While the pieces here
collected were confined to their appropriate sphere in the corners of obscure
newspapers, we considered them wholly beneath contempt, but, as the
author has chosen to come forward in this public manner, he must expect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
the lash he so richly merits.... Contemptible slanders.... Vilest Billingsgate....
Has raked all the gutters of our language.... The most
pure, upright, and consistent politicians not safe from his malignant
venom.... General Cushing comes in for a share of his vile calumnies....
The <i>Reverend</i> Homer Wilbur is a disgrace to his cloth....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the World-Harmonic-&AElig;olian-Attachment.</i></p>

<p>Speech is silver: silence is golden. No utterance more Orphic than
this. While, therefore, as highest author, we reverence him whose works
continue heroically unwritten, we have also our hopeful word for those
who with pen (from wing of goose loud-cackling, or seraph God-commissioned)
record the thing that is revealed.... Under mask of quaintest
irony, we detect here the deep, storm-tost (nigh shipwracked) soul, thunder-scarred,
semiarticulate, but ever climbing hopefully toward the peaceful
summits of an Infinite Sorrow.... Yes, thou poor, forlorn Hosea, with
Hebrew fire-flaming soul in thee, for thee also this life of ours has not
been without its aspect of heavenliest pity and laughingest mirth. Conceivable
enough! Through coarse Thersites-cloak, we have revelation of
the heart, wild-glowing, world-clasping, that is in him. Bravely he grapples
with the life-problem as it presents itself to him, uncombed, shaggy,
careless of the "nicer proprieties," inexpert of "elegant diction," yet with
voice audible enough to whoso hath ears, up there on the gravelly side-hills,
or down on the splashy, Indiarubber-like salt-marshes of native
Jaalam. To this soul also the <i>Necessity of Creating</i> somewhat has unveiled
its awful front. If not &#338;dipuses and Electras and Alcestises, then
in God's name Birdofredum Sawins! These also shall get born into the
world, and filch (if so need) a Zingali subsistence therein, these lank,
omnivorous Yankees of his. He shall paint the Seen, since the Unseen
will not sit to him. Yet in him also are Nibelungen-lays, and Iliads, and
Ulysses-wanderings, and Divine Comedies,&mdash;if only once he could come at
them! Therein lies much, nay all; for what truly is this which we name
<i>All</i>, but that which we do <i>not</i> possess?... Glimpses also are given us of
an old father Ezekiel, not without paternal pride, as is the wont of such.
A brown, parchment-hided old man of the geoponic or bucolic species,
gray-eyed, we fancy, <i>queued</i> perhaps, with much weather-cunning and
plentiful September-gale memories, bidding fair in good time to become
the Oldest Inhabitant. After such hasty apparition, he vanishes and is
seen no more.... Of "Rev. Homer Wilbur, A. M., Pastor of the First<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
Church in Jaalam," we have small care to speak here. Spare touch in
him of his Melesigenes namesake, save, haply, the&mdash;blindness! A
tolerably caliginose, nephelegeretous elderly gentleman, with infinite
faculty of sermonizing, muscularized by long practice, and excellent
digestive apparatus, and, for the rest, well-meaning enough, and with
small private illuminations (somewhat tallowy, it is to be feared) of
his own. To him, there, "Pastor of the First Church in Jaalam,"
our Hosea presents himself as a quiet inexplicable Sphinx-riddle. A
rich, poverty of Latin and Greek,&mdash;so far is clear enough, even to
eyes peering myopic through horn-lensed editorial spectacles,&mdash;but
naught farther? O purblind, well-meaning, altogether fuscous Melesigenes-Wilbur,
there are things in him incommunicable by stroke of
birch! Did it ever enter that old bewildered head of thine that there was
the <i>Possibility of the Infinite</i> in him? To thee, quite wingless (and even
featherless) biped, has not so much even as a dream of wings ever come?
"Talented young parishioner"? Among the Arts whereof thou art
<i>Magister</i>, does that of <i>seeing</i> happen to be one? Unhappy <i>Artium
Magister</i>! Somehow a Nemean lion, fulvous, torrid-eyed, dry-nursed in
broad-howling sand-wildernesses of a sufficiently rare spirit-Libya (it may
be supposed) has got whelped among the sheep. Already he stands wild-glaring,
with feet clutching the ground as with oak-roots, gathering for a
Remus-spring over the walls of thy little fold. In Heaven's name, go
not near him with that flybite crook of thine! In good time, thou painful
preacher, thou wilt go to the appointed place of departed Artillery-Election
Sermons, Right-Hands of Fellowship, and Results of Councils,
gathered to thy spiritual fathers with much Latin of the Epitaphial sort;
thou, too, shalt have thy reward; but on him the Eumenides have looked,
not Xantippes of the pit, snake-tressed, finger-threatening, but radiantly
calm as on antique gems; for him paws impatient the winged courser of
the gods, champing unwelcome bit: him the starry deeps, the empyrean
glooms, and far-flashing splendors await.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the Onion Grove Ph&#339;nix.</i></p>

<p>A talented young townsman of ours, recently returned from a Continental
tour, and who is already favourably known to our readers by his
sprightly letters from abroad which have graced our columns, called at our
office yesterday. We learn from him, that, having enjoyed the distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
privilege, while in Germany, of an introduction to the celebrated Von
Humbug, he took the opportunity to present that eminent man with a
copy of the "Biglow Papers." The next morning he received the following
note, which he has kindly furnished us for publication. We prefer to
print <i>verbatim</i>, knowing that our readers will readily forgive the few errors
into which the illustrious writer has fallen, through ignorance of our
language.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">High-Worthy Mister!</span></p>

<p>"I shall also now especially happy starve, because I have more or less
a work of one those aboriginal Red-Men seen in which have I so deaf an
interest ever taken fullworthy on the self shelf with our Gottsched to be
upset.</p>

<p>"Pardon my in the English-speech unpractice!</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Von Humbug.</span>"</p>

<p>He also sent with the above note a copy of his famous work on "Cosmetics,"
to be presented to Mr. Biglow; but this was taken from our
friend by the English custom-house officers, probably through a petty
national spite. No doubt, it has by this time found its way into the
British Museum. We trust this outrage will be exposed in all our American
papers. We shall do our best to bring it to the notice of the State
Department. Our numerous readers will share in the pleasure we experience
at seeing our young and vigorous national literature thus encouragingly
patted on the head by this venerable and world-renowned German.
We love to see these reciprocations of good-feeling between the different
branches of the great Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>From the Jaalam Independent Blunderbuss.</i></p>

<p>... But, while we lament to see our young townsman thus mingling
in the heated contests of party politics, we think we detect in him the
presence of talents which, if properly directed, might give an innocent
pleasure to many. As a proof that he is competent to the production of
other kinds of poetry, we copy for our readers a short fragment of a pastoral
by him, the manuscript of which was loaned us by a friend. The
title of it is "The Courtin'."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>Toga scholastica nondum deposita, quum systemata varia
entomologica, a viris ejus scienti&aelig; cultoribus studiosissimis
summa diligentia &aelig;dificata, penitus indag&acirc;ssem, non fuit quin
luctuose omnibus in iis, quamvis aliter laude dignissimis,
hiatum magni momenti perciperem. Tunc, nescio quo motu
superiore impulsus, aut qua captus dulcedine operis, ad eum
implendum (Curtius alter) me solemniter devovi. Nec ab isto
labore, <span title="daimoni&ocirc;s">&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#969;&#962;</span> imposito, abstinui antequam tractatulum

(necnon "Publici Legentis") nusquam explorato, me composuisse
quod quasi placentas pr&aelig;fervidas (ut sic dicam) homines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
ingurgitarent credidi. Sed, quum huic et alii bibliopol&aelig;
MSS. mea submisissem et nihil solidius responsione valde negativa
in Mus&aelig;um meum retulissem, horror ingens atque
misericordia, ob crassitudinem Lambertianam in cerebris
homunculorum istius muneris c&#339;lesti quadam ira infixam, me
invasere. Extemplo mei solius impensis librum edere decrevi,
nihil omnino dubitans quin "Mundus Scientificus" (ut aiunt)
crumenam meam ampliter repleret. Nullam, attamen, ex agro
illo meo parvulo segetem demessui, pr&aelig;ter gaudium vacuum
bene de Republica merendi. Iste panis meus pretiosus super
aquas literarias f&aelig;culentas pr&aelig;fidenter jactus, quasi Harpyiarum
quarundam (scilicet bibliopolarum istorum facinorosorum
supradictorum) tactu rancidus, intra perpaucos dies
mihi domum rediit. Et, quum ipse tali victu ali non tolerarem,
primum in mentem venit pistori (typographo nempe) nihilominus
solvendum esse. Animum non idcirco demisi, imo
&aelig;que ac pueri naviculas suas penes se lino retinent (eo ut e
recto cursu delapsas ad ripam retrahant), sic ego Arg&ocirc; meam
chartaceam fluctibus laborantem a qu&aelig;situ velleris aurei, ipse
potius tonsus pelleque exutus, mente solida revocavi. Metaphoram
ut mutem, <i>boomarangam</i> meam a scopo aberrantem
retraxi, dum majore vi, occasione ministrante, adversus Fortunam
intorquerem. Ast mihi, talia volventi, et, sicut
Saturnus ille <span title="paidoboros">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#946;&#8057;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, liberos intellectus mei depascere
fidenti, casus miserandus, nec antea inauditus, supervenit.
Nam, ut ferunt Scythas pietatis causa et parsimoni&aelig;, parentes
suos mortuos devor&acirc;sse, sic filius hic meus primogenitus,
Scythis ipsis minus mansuetus, patrem vivum totum
et calcitrantem exsorbere enixus est. Nec tamen hac de causa
sobolem meam esurientem exheredavi. Sed famem istam pro
valido testimonio virilitatis roborisque potius habui, cibumque
ad eam satiandam salva paterna mea carne, petii. Et quia
bilem illam scaturientem ad &aelig;s etiam concoquendum idoneam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
esse estimabam, unde &aelig;s alienum, ut minoris pretii, haberem,
circumspexi. Rebus ita se habentibus, ab avunculo meo
Johanne Doolittle, Armigero, impetravi ut pecunias necessarias
suppeditaret, ne opus esset mihi universitatem relinquendi
antequam ad gradum primum in artibus pervenissem.
Tunc ego, salvum facere patronum meum munificum maxime
cupiens, omnes libros prim&aelig; editionis operis mei non venditos
una cum privilegio in omne &aelig;vum ejusdem imprimendi et
edendi avunculo meo dicto pigneravi. Ex illo die, atro lapide
notando, cur&aelig; vociferantes famili&aelig; singulis annis crescentis
eo usque insultabant ut nunquam tam carum pignus e vinculis
istis aheneis solvere possem.</p>

<p>Avunculo vero nuper mortuo, quum inter alios consanguineos
testamenti ejus lectionem audiendi causa advenissem,
erectis auribus verba talia sequentia accepi:&mdash;"Quoniam persuasum
habeo meum dilectum nepotem Homerum, longa et
intima rerum angustarum domi experientia, aptissimum esse
qui divitias tueatur, beneficenterque ac prudenter iis divinis
creditis utatur,&mdash;ergo, motus hisce cogitationibus, exque
amore meo in illum magno, do, legoque nepoti caro meo
supranominato omnes singularesque istas possessiones nec
ponderabiles nec computabiles meas qu&aelig; sequuntur, scilicet:
quingentos libros quos mihi pigneravit dictus Homerus, anno
lucis 1792, cum privilegio edendi et repetendi opus istud
'scientificum' (quod dicunt) suum, si sic elegerit. Tamen
D. O. M. precor oculos Homeri nepotis mei ita aperiat eumque
moveat, ut libros istos in bibliotheca unius e plurimis castellis
suis Hispaniensibus tuto abscondat."</p>

<p>His verbis (vix credibilibus) auditis, cor meum in pectore
exsultavit. Deinde, quoniam tractatus Anglice scriptus spem
auctoris fefellerat, quippe quum studium Histori&aelig; Naturalis in
Republica nostra inter factionis strepitum languescat, Latine
versum edere statui, et eo potius quia nescio quomodo disciplina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>

<h2><a name="NOTE_TO_TITLE-PAGE" id="NOTE_TO_TITLE-PAGE"></a>NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE</h2>


<p>It will not have escaped the attentive eye, that I have, on
the title-page, omitted those honorary appendages to the
editorial name which not only add greatly to the value of
every book, but whet and exacerbate the appetite of the
reader. For not only does he surmise that an honorary
membership of literary and scientific societies implies a certain
amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of
such decorations, but he is willing to trust himself more
entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility
of involving the reputation of such bodies as the <i>S.
Arch&aelig;ol. Dahom.</i>, or the <i>Acad. Lit. et Scient. Kamtschat.</i> I
cannot but think that the early editions of Shakspeare and
Milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance,
but for the barrenness of their respective title-pages;
and I believe that, even now, a publisher of the works of
either of those justly distinguished men would find his account
in procuring their admission to the membership of learned
bodies on the Continent,&mdash;a proceeding no whit more incongruous
than the reversal of the judgment against Socrates,
when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the
reach of antidotes, and when his memory had acquired a deserved
respectability. I conceive that it was a feeling of the importance
of this precaution which induced Mr. Locke to style
himself "Gent." on the title-page of his Essay, as who should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
say to his readers that they could receive his metaphysics on
the honor of a gentleman.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, finding, that, without descending to a smaller
size of type than would have been compatible with the dignity
of the several societies to be named, I could not compress my
intended list within the limits of a single page, and thinking,
moreover, that the act would carry with it an air of decorous
modesty, I have chosen to take the reader aside, as it were,
into my private closet, and there not only exhibit to him the
diplomas which I already possess, but also to furnish him with
a prophetic vision of those which I may, without undue presumption,
hope for, as not beyond the reach of human ambition
and attainment. And I am the rather induced to this from the
fact, that my name has been unaccountably dropped from the
last triennial catalogue of our beloved <i>Alma Mater</i>. Whether
this is to be attributed to the difficulty of Latinizing any of
those honorary adjuncts (with a complete list of which I took
care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year beforehand),
or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives, I
forbear to consider in this place, the matter being in course of
painful investigation. But, however this may be, I felt the
omission the more keenly, as I had, in expectation of the new
catalogue, enriched the library of the Jaalam Athen&aelig;um with
the old one then in my possession, by which means it has
come about that my children will be deprived of a never-wearying
winter-evening's amusement in looking out the name
of their parent in that distinguished roll. Those harmless
innocents had at least committed no&mdash;&mdash;but I forbear, having
intrusted my reflections and animadversions on this painful
topic to the safe-keeping of my private diary, intended for
posthumous publication. I state this fact here, in order that
certain nameless individuals, who are, perhaps, overmuch congratulating
themselves upon my silence, may know that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
rod is in pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed
posterity will apply to their memories.</p>

<p>The careful reader will note, that, in the list which I have
prepared, I have included the names of several Cisatlantic societies
to which a place is not commonly assigned in processions
of this nature. I have ventured to do this, not only to
encourage native ambition and genius, but also because I have
never been able to perceive in what way distance (unless we
suppose them at the end of a lever) could increase the weight
of learned bodies. As far as I have been able to extend my
researches among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach
America, I have discovered no generic difference between the
antipodal <i>Fogrum Japonicum</i> and the <i>F. Americanum</i> sufficiently
common in our own immediate neighbourhood. Yet, with a
becoming deference to the popular belief, that distinctions of
this sort are enhanced in value by every additional mile they
travel, I have intermixed the names of some tolerably distant
literary and other associations with the rest.</p>

<p>I add here, also, an advertisement, which, that it may be the
more readily understood by those persons especially interested
therein, I have written in that curtailed and otherwise maltreated
canine Latin, to the writing and reading of which they
are accustomed.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>When, more than three years ago, my talented young
parishioner, Mr. Biglow, came to me and submitted to
my animadversions the first of his poems which he
intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a
city newspaper, it never so much as entered my
imagination to conceive that his productions would
ever be gathered into a fair volume, and ushered into
the august presence of the reading public by myself.
So little are we short-sighted mortals able to predict
the event! I confess that there is to me a quite new
satisfaction in being associated (though only as sleeping
partner) in a book which can stand by itself in an
independent unity on the shelves of libraries. For there
is always this drawback from the pleasure of printing a
sermon, that, whereas the queasy stomach of this generation
will not bear a discourse long enough to make
a separate volume, those religious and godly-minded
children (those Samuels, if I may call them so) of the
brain must at first lie buried in an undistinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
heap, and then get such resurrection as is vouchsafed
to them, mummy-wrapt with a score of others in a
cheap binding, with no other mark of distinction than
the word "<i>Miscellaneous</i>" printed upon the back. Far
be it from me to claim any credit for the quite unexpected
popularity which I am pleased to find these
bucolic strains have attained unto. If I know myself,
I am measurably free from the itch of vanity; yet I
may be allowed to say that I was not backward to
recognize in them a certain wild, puckery, acidulous
(sometimes even verging toward that point which, in
our rustic phrase, is termed <i>shut-eye</i>) flavour, not wholly
unpleasing, nor unwholesome, to palates cloyed with
the sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit. It may
be, also, that some touches of my own, here and there,
may have led to their wider acceptance, albeit solely
from my larger experience of literature and authorship.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>I was, at first, inclined to discourage Mr. Biglow's
attempts, as knowing that the desire to poetize is one
of the diseases naturally incident to adolescence, which,
if the fitting remedies be not at once and with a bold
hand applied, may become chronic, and render one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
who might else have become in due time an ornament
of the social circle, a painful object even to nearest
friends and relatives. But thinking, on a further
experience, that there was a germ of promise in him
which required only culture and the pulling up of
weeds from around it, I thought it best to set before
him the acknowledged examples of English compositions
in verse, and leave the rest to natural emulation.
With this view, I accordingly lent him some
volumes of Pope and Goldsmith, to the assiduous study
of which he promised to devote his evenings. Not
long afterwards he brought me some verses written
upon that model, a specimen of which I subjoin, having
changed some phrases of less elegancy, and a few
rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear. The poem
consisted of childish reminiscences, and the sketches
which follow will not seem destitute of truth to those
whose fortunate education began in a country village.
And, first, let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the
school-dame.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">To guttural Pequot or resounding Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vibrant accent skipping here and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as it pleased invention or despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No controversial Hebraist was the Dame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With or without the points pleased her the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any tyro found a name too tough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked at her, pride furnished skill enough;<br /></span>

<p>I add only one further extract, which will possess
a melancholy interest to all such as have endeavoured
to glean the materials of Revolutionary history from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
the lips of aged persons, who took a part in the actual
making of it, and, finding the manufacture profitable,
continued the supply in an adequate proportion to the
demand.</p>

<p>I do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not
to be called my own rather than Mr. Biglow's, as,
indeed, he maintained stoutly that my file had left
nothing of his in them. I should not, perhaps, have
felt entitled to take so great liberties with them, had I
not more than suspected an hereditary vein of poetry
in myself, a very near ancestor having written a Latin
poem in the Harvard <i>Gratulatio</i> on the accession of
George the Third. Suffice it to say, that, whether not
satisfied with such limited approbation as I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
conscientiously bestow, or from a sense of natural
inaptitude, I know not, certain it is that my young
friend could never be induced to any further essays in
this kind. He affirmed that it was to him like writing
in a foreign tongue,&mdash;that Mr. Pope's versification was
like the regular ticking of one of Willard's clocks, in
which one could fancy, after long listening, a certain
kind of rhythm or tune, but which yet was only a
poverty-stricken <i>tick, tick</i> after all,&mdash;and that he had
never seen a sweet-water on a trellis growing so fairly,
or in forms so pleasing to his eye, as a fox-grape over
a scrub-oak in a swamp. He added I know not what,
to the effect that the sweet-water would only be the
more disfigured by having its leaves starched and
ironed out, and that Peg&#257;sus (so he called him) hardly
looked right with his mane and tail in curl-papers.
These and other such opinions I did not long strive
to eradicate, attributing them rather to a defective
education and senses untuned by too long familiarity
with purely natural objects, than to a perverted moral
sense. I was the more inclined to this leniency since
sufficient evidence was not to seek, that his verses, as
wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and
point, had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a
surprising manner. So, only setting him right as to
the quantity of the proper name Pegasus, I left him
to follow the bent of his natural genius.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two things upon which it would seem
fitting to dilate somewhat more largely in this place,&mdash;the
Yankee character and the Yankee dialect. And,
first, of the Yankee character, which has wanted neither
open maligners, nor even more dangerous enemies in
the persons of those unskilful painters who have given
to it that hardness, angularity, and want of proper
perspective, which, in truth, belonged, not to their
subject, but to their own niggard and unskilful
pencil.</p>

<p>New England was not so much the colony of a
mother country, as a Hagar driven forth into the
wilderness. The little self-exiled band which came
hither in 1620 came, not to seek gold, but to found
a democracy. They came that they might have the
privilege to work and pray, to sit upon hard benches
and listen to painful preachers as long as they would,
yea, even unto thirty-seventhly, if the spirit so willed
it. And surely, if the Greek might boast his Thermopyl&aelig;,
where three hundred men fell in resisting the
Persian, we may well be proud of our Plymouth Rock,
where a handful of men, women, and children not
merely faced, but vanquished, winter, famine, the wilderness,
and the yet more invincible <i>storge</i> that drew them
back to the green island far away. These found no
lotus growing upon the surly shore, the taste of which
could make them forget their little native Ithaca; nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
were they so wanting to themselves in faith as to burn
their ship, but could see the fair west wind belly the
homeward sail, and then turn unrepining to grapple
with the terrible Unknown.</p>

<p>As Want was the prime foe these hardy exodists
had to fortress themselves against, so it is little wonder
if that traditional feud is long in wearing out of the
stock. The wounds of the old warfare were long ahealing,
and an east wind of hard times puts a new ache
in every one of them. Thrift was the first lesson in
their horn-book, pointed out, letter after letter, by the
lean finger of the hard schoolmaster, Necessity. Neither
were those plump, rosy-gilled Englishmen that came
hither, but a hard-faced, atrabilious, earnest-eyed race,
stiff from long wrestling with the Lord in prayer, and
who had taught Satan to dread the new Puritan hug.
Add two hundred years' influence of soil, climate, and
exposure, with its necessary result of idiosyncrasies,
and we have the present Yankee, full of expedients,
half-master of all trades, inventive in all but the beautiful,
full of shifts, not yet capable of comfort, armed
at all points against the old enemy Hunger, longanimous,
good at patching, not so careful for what is best
as for what will <i>do</i>, with a clasp to his purse and a
button to his pocket, not skilled to build against Time,
as in old countries, but against sore-pressing Need,
accustomed to move the world with no <span title="pou st&ocirc;">&#960;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#964;&#8182;</span> but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
his own two feet, and no lever but his own long forecast.
A strange hybrid, indeed, did circumstance beget,
here in the New World, upon the old Puritan stock,
and the earth never before saw such mystic-practicalism,
such niggard-geniality, such calculating-fanaticism,
such cast-iron-enthusiasm, such unwilling humour, such
close-fisted-generosity. This new <i>Gr&aelig;culus esuriens</i>
will make a living out of any thing. He will invent
new trades as well as tools. His brain is his capital,
and he will get education at all risks. Put him on
Juan Fernandez, and he would make a spelling-book
first, and a salt-pan afterwards. <i>In c&#339;lum, jusseris,
ibit</i>,&mdash;or the other way either,&mdash;it is all one, so any
thing is to be got by it. Yet, after all, thin, speculative
Jonathan is more like the Englishman of two centuries
ago than John Bull himself is. He has lost somewhat
in solidity, has become fluent and adaptable, but more
of the original groundwork of character remains. He
feels more at home with Fulke Greville, Herbert of
Cherbury, Quarles, George Herbert, and Browne, than
with his modern English cousins. He is nearer than
John, by at least a hundred years, to Naseby, Marston
Moor, Worcester, and the time when, if ever, there
were true Englishmen. John Bull has suffered the
idea of the Invisible to be very much flattened out of
him. Jonathan is conscious still that he lives in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
world of the Unseen as well as of the Seen. To move
John, you must make your fulcrum of solid beef and
pudding; an abstract idea will do for Jonathan.</p>

<p class="head6"><b><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> TO THE INDULGENT READER.</b></p>

<p>My friend, the Rev. Mr. Wilbur, having been seized with a
dangerous fit of illness, before this Introduction had passed
through the press, and being incapacitated for all literary exertion,
sent to me his notes, memoranda, &amp;c., and requested
me to fashion them into some shape more fitting for the general
eye. This, owing to the fragmentary and disjointed state
of his manuscripts, I have felt wholly unable to do; yet, being
unwilling that the reader should be deprived of such parts of
his lucubrations as seemed more finished, and not well discerning
how to segregate these from the rest, I have concluded to
send them all to the press precisely as they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbus Nye</span>, <i>Pastor of a Church in Bungtown Corner</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It remains to speak of the Yankee dialect. And,
first, it may be premised, in a general way, that any
one much read in the writings of the early colonists
need not be told that the far greater share of the words
and phrases now esteemed peculiar to New England,
and local there, were brought from the mother-country.
A person familiar with the dialect of certain portions
of Massachusetts will not fail to recognize, in ordinary
discourse, many words now noted in English vocabularies
as archaic, the greater part of which were in common
use about the time of the King James translation
of the Bible. Shakspeare stands less in need of a glossary
to most New Englanders than to many a native of
the Old Country. The peculiarities of our speech,
however, are rapidly wearing out. As there is no
country where reading is so universal and newspapers
are so multitudinous, so no phrase remains long local,
but is transplanted in the mail-bags to every remotest
corner of the land. Consequently our dialect approaches
nearer to uniformity than that of any other nation.</p>

<p>The English have complained of us for coining new
words. Many of those so stigmatized were old ones
by them forgotten, and all make now an unquestioned
part of the currency, wherever English is spoken.
Undoubtedly, we have a right to make new words, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>
they are needed by the fresh aspects under which life
presents itself here in the New World; and, indeed,
wherever a language is alive, it grows. It might be
questioned whether we could not establish a stronger
title to the ownership of the English tongue than the
mother-islanders themselves. Here, past all question,
is to be its great home and centre. And not only is it
already spoken here by greater numbers, but with a far
higher popular average of correctness, than in Britain.
The great writers of it, too, we might claim as ours,
were ownership to be settled by the number of readers
and lovers.</p>

<p>As regards the provincialisms to be met with in this
volume, I may say that the reader will not find one
which is not (as I believe) either native or imported
with the early settlers, nor one which I have not, with
my own ears, heard in familiar use. In the metrical
portion of the book, I have endeavoured to adapt the
spelling as nearly as possible to the ordinary mode of
pronunciation. Let the reader who deems me overparticular
remember this caution of Martial:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Quem recitas, meus est, O Fidentine, libellus;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sed male cum recitas, incipit esse tuus.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A few further explanatory remarks will not be impertinent.</p>

<p>I shall barely lay down a few general rules for the
reader's guidance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The genuine Yankee never gives the rough sound
to the <i>r</i> when he can help it, and often displays considerable
ingenuity in avoiding it even before a vowel.</p>

<p>2. He seldom sounds the final <i>g</i>, a piece of self-denial,
if we consider his partiality for nasals. The
same of the final <i>d</i>, as <i>han'</i> and <i>stan'</i> for <i>hand</i> and
<i>stand</i>.</p>

<p>3. The <i>h</i> in such words as <i>while</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, he omits
altogether.</p>

<p>4. In regard to <i>a</i>, he shows some inconsistency,
sometimes giving a close and obscure sound, as <i>hev</i> for
<i>have</i>, <i>hendy</i> for <i>handy</i>, <i>ez</i> for <i>as</i>, <i>thet</i> for <i>that</i>, and again
giving it the broad sound it has in <i>father</i>, as <i>h&acirc;nsome</i>
for <i>handsome</i>.</p>

<p>5. To the sound <i>ou</i> he prefixes an <i>e</i> (hard to exemplify
otherwise than orally).</p>

<p>The following passage in Shakspeare he would recite
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Neow is the winta uv eour discontent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Med glorious summa by this sun o' Yock,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He capers nimly in a lady's ch&#259;mber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the lascivious pleasin' uv a loot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>6. <i>Au</i>, in such words as <i>daughter</i> and <i>slaughter</i>, he
pronounces <i>ah</i>.</p>

<p>7. To the dish thus seasoned add a drawl <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>


<p class="center">[Mr. Wilbur's notes here become entirely fragmentary.&mdash;C. N.]</p>


<p><span title="a">&#945;</span>. Unable to procure a likeness of Mr. Biglow, I
thought the curious reader might be gratified with a
sight of the editorial effigies. And here a choice between
two was offered,&mdash;the one a profile (entirely
black) cut by Doyle, the other a portrait painted by a
native artist of much promise. The first of these
seemed wanting in expression, and in the second a
slight obliquity of the visual organs has been heightened
(perhaps from an over-desire of force on the part of the
artist) into too close an approach to actual <i>strabismus</i>.
This slight divergence in my optical apparatus from the
ordinary model&mdash;however I may have been taught to
regard it in the light of a mercy rather than a cross,
since it enabled me to give as much of directness and
personal application to my discourses as met the wants
of my congregation, without risk of offending any by
being supposed to have him or her in my eye (as the
saying is)&mdash;seemed yet to Mrs. Wilbur a sufficient objection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
to the engraving of the aforesaid painting. We
read of many who either absolutely refused to allow the
copying of their features, as especially did Plotinus and
Agesilaus among the ancients, not to mention the more
modern instances of Scioppius Pal&aelig;ottus, Pinellus,
Velserus, Gataker, and others, or were indifferent
thereto, as Cromwell.</p>

<p><span title="b">&#946;</span>. Yet was C&aelig;sar desirous of concealing his baldness.
<i>Per contra</i>, my Lord Protector's carefulness in the
matter of his wart might be cited. Men generally
more desirous of being <i>improved</i> in their portraits than
characters. Shall probably find very unflattered likenesses
of ourselves in Recording Angel's gallery.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span title="g">&#947;</span>. Whether any of our national peculiarities may be
traced to our use of stoves, as a certain closeness of the
lips in pronunciation, and a smothered smoulderingness
of disposition, seldom roused to open flame? An unrestrained
intercourse with fire probably conducive to
generosity and hospitality of soul. Ancient Mexicans
used stoves, as the friar Augustin Ruiz reports, Hakluyt,
III., 468,&mdash;but Popish priests not always reliable
authority.</p>

<p>To-day picked my Isabella grapes. Crop injured by
attacks of rose-bug in the spring. Whether Noah was
justifiable in preserving this class of insects?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span></p>

<p><span title="d">&#948;</span>. Concerning Mr. Biglow's pedigree. Tolerably certain
that there was never a poet among his ancestors.
An ordination hymn attributed to a maternal uncle,
but perhaps a sort of production not demanding the
creative faculty.</p>

<p>His grandfather a painter of the grandiose or Michael
Angelo school. Seldom painted objects smaller than
houses or barns, and these with uncommon expression.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span title="e">&#949;</span>. Of the Wilburs no complete pedigree. The crest
said to be a <i>wild boar</i>, whence, perhaps, the name. (?)
A connection with the Earls of Wilbraham (<i>quasi</i> wild
boar ham) might be made out. This suggestion worth
following up. In 1677, John W. m. Expect &mdash;&mdash;, had
issue, 1. John, 2. Haggai, 3. Expect, 4. Ruhamah,
5. Desire.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>This is unquestionably the same John who afterward

<p>But if this were the case, she seems to have died<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
early; for only three years after, namely, 1714, we
have evidence that he married Winifred, daughter of
Lieutenant Tipping.</p>

<p>He seems to have been a man of substance, for we
find him in 1696 conveying "one undivided eightieth
part of a salt-meadow" in Yabbok, and he commanded
a sloop in 1702.</p>

<p>Those who doubt the importance of genealogical
studies <i>fuste potius quam argumento erudiendi</i>.</p>

<p>I trace him as far as 1723, and there lose him. In
that year he was chosen selectman.</p>

<p>No gravestone. Perhaps overthrown when new
hearse-house was built, 1802.</p>

<p>He was probably the son of John, who came from
Bilham Comit. Salop. circa 1642.</p>

<p>This first John was a man of considerable importance,
being twice mentioned with the honourable prefix of
<i>Mr.</i> in the town records. Name spelt with two <i>l</i>-s.</p>

<p>It is greatly to be lamented that this curious epitaph
is mutilated. It is said that the sacrilegious British
soldiers made a target of this stone during the war of
Independence. How odious an animosity which pauses
not at the grave! How brutal that which spares not
the monuments of authentic history! This is not improbably
from the pen of Rev. Moddy Pyram, who is
mentioned by Hubbard as having been noted for a
silver vein of poetry. If his papers be still extant, a
copy might possibly be recovered.</p>

<span class="smcap">Jaylem</span>, june 1846.

<p><span class="smcap">Mister Eddyter</span>:&mdash;Our Hosea wuz down to Boston

<div class="hw"><p>[The first recruiting sergeant on record I conceive to have
been that individual who is mentioned in the Book of Job as
<i>going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it</i>.
Bishop Latimer will have him to have been a bishop, but to
me that other calling would appear more congenial. The sect
of Cainites is not yet extinct, who esteemed the first-born of
Adam to be the most worthy, not only because of that privilege
of primogeniture, but inasmuch as he was able to overcome
and slay his younger brother. That was a wise saying of the
famous Marquis Pescara to the Papal Legate, that <i>it was impossible
for men to serve Mars and Christ at the same time</i>.
Yet in time past the profession of arms was judged to be <span title="kat' exoch&ecirc;n">&#954;&#945;&#964;' &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#8053;&#957;</span>
that of a gentleman, nor does this opinion want for
strenuous upholders even in our day. Must we suppose, then,
that the profession of Christianity was only intended for losels,
or, at best, to afford an opening for plebeian ambition? Or
shall we hold with that nicely metaphysical Pomeranian,
Captain Vratz, who was Count K&ouml;nigsmark's chief instrument
in the murder of Mr. Thynne, that the scheme of salvation
has been arranged with an especial eye to the necessities of the
upper classes, and that "God would consider <i>a gentleman</i>, and
deal with him suitably to the condition and profession he had
placed him in"? It may be said of us all, <i>Exemplo plus quam
ratione vivimus</i>.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<h3>A LETTER</h3>

<p class="hdtt">FROM MR. HOSEA BIGLOW TO THE HON. J. T. BUCKINGHAM,
EDITOR OF THE BOSTON COURIER, COVERING A LETTER FROM
MR. B. SAWIN, PRIVATE IN THE MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT.</p>


<div class="hw"><p>[This letter of Mr. Sawin's was not originally written in
verse. Mr. Biglow, thinking it peculiarly susceptible of
metrical adornment, translated it, so to speak, into his own
vernacular tongue. This is not the time to consider the
question, whether rhyme be a mode of expression natural to
the human race. If leisure from other and more important
avocations be granted, I will handle the matter more at large
in an appendix to the present volume. In this place I will
barely remark, that I have sometimes noticed in the unlanguaged
prattlings of infants a fondness for alliteration,
assonance, and even rhyme, in which natural predisposition we
may trace the three degrees through which our Anglo-Saxon
verse rose to its culmination in the poetry of Pope. I would
not be understood as questioning in these remarks that pious
theory which supposes that children, if left entirely to themselves,
would naturally discourse in Hebrew. For this the
authority of one experiment is claimed, and I could, with Sir
Thomas Browne, desire its establishment, inasmuch as the
acquirement of that sacred tongue would thereby be facilitated.
I am aware that Herodotus states the conclusion of Psammiticus
to have been in favour of a dialect of the Phrygian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
But, beside the chance that a trial of this importance would
hardly be blessed to a Pagan monarch whose only motive was
curiosity, we have on the Hebrew side the comparatively
recent investigation of James the Fourth of Scotland. I will
add to this prefatory remark, that Mr. Sawin, though a native
of Jaalam, has never been a stated attendant on the religious
exercises of my congregation. I consider my humble efforts
prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the
wolf's clothing of war, save for the comparatively innocent
diversion of a militia training. Not that my flock are backward
to undergo the hardships of <i>defensive</i> warfare. They serve
cheerfully in the great army which fights even unto death <i>pro
aris et focis</i>, accoutred with the spade, the axe, the plane, the
sledge, the spelling-book, and other such effectual weapons
against want and ignorance and unthrift. I have taught them
(under God) to esteem our human institutions as but tents of
a night, to be stricken whenever Truth puts the bugle to her
lips, and sounds a march to the heights of wider-viewed intelligence
and more perfect organization.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<div class="hw"><p>[Those have not been wanting (as, indeed, when hath Satan
been to seek for attorneys?) who have maintained that our
late inroad upon Mexico was undertaken, not so much for the
avenging of any national quarrel, as for the spreading of free
institutions and of Protestantism. <i>Capita vix duabus Anticyris
medenda!</i> Verily I admire that no pious sergeant among
these new Crusaders beheld Martin Luther riding at the front
of the host upon a tamed pontifical bull, as, in that former invasion
of Mexico, the zealous Diaz (spawn though he were of
the Scarlet Woman) was favoured with a vision of St. James
of Compostella, skewering the infidels upon his apostolical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
lance. We read, also, that Richard of the lion heart, having
gone to Palestine on a similar errand of mercy, was divinely
encouraged to cut the throats of such Paynims as refused to
swallow the bread of life (doubtless that they might be thereafter
incapacitated for swallowing the filthy gobbets of Mahound)
by angels of heaven, who cried to the king and his
knights,&mdash;<i>Seigneurs, tuez! tuez!</i> providentially using the
French tongue, as being the only one understood by their
auditors. This would argue for the pantoglottism of these
celestial intelligences, while, on the other hand, the Devil,
<i>teste</i> Cotton Mather, is unversed in certain of the Indian
dialects. Yet must he be a semeiologist the most expert,
making himself intelligible to every people and kindred by
signs; no other discourse, indeed, being needful, than such as
the mackerel-fisher holds with his finned quarry, who, if other
bait be wanting, can by a bare bit of white rag at the end of
a string captivate those foolish fishes. Such piscatorial
oratory is Satan cunning in. Before one he trails a hat and
feather, or a bare feather without a hat; before another, a
Presidential chair, or a tidewaiter's stool, or a pulpit in the
city, no matter what. To us, dangling there over our heads,
they seem junkets dropped out of the seventh heaven, sops
dipped in nectar, but, once in our mouths, they are all one,
bits of fuzzy cotton.</p>

<p>This, however, by the way. It is time now <i>revocare gradum</i>.
While so many miracles of this sort, vouched by eye-witnesses,
have encouraged the arms of Papists, not to speak of those
<i>Dioscuri</i> (whom we must conclude imps of the pit) who sundry
times captained the pagan Roman soldiery, it is strange that
our first American crusade was not in some such wise also
signalized. Yet it is said that the Lord hath manifestly prospered
our armies. This opens the question, whether, when
our hands are strengthened to make great slaughter of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
enemies, it be absolutely and demonstratively certain that this
might is added to us from above, or whether some Potentate
from an opposite quarter may not have a finger in it, as there
are few pies into which his meddling digits are not thrust.
Would the Sanctifier and Setter-apart of the seventh day have
assisted in a victory gained on the Sabbath, as was one in the
late war? Or has that day become less an object of his especial
care since the year 1697, when so manifest a providence
occurred to Mr. William Trowbridge, in answer to whose
prayers, when he and all on shipboard with him were starving,
a dolphin was sent daily, "which was enough to serve
'em; only on <i>Saturdays</i> they still catched a couple, and on the
<i>Lord's Days</i> they could catch none at all"? Haply they might
have been permitted, by way of mortification, to take some few
sculpins (those banes of the salt-water angler), which unseemly
fish would, moreover, have conveyed to them a symbolical reproof
for their breach of the day, being known in the rude
dialect of our mariners as <i>Cape Cod Clergymen</i>.</p>

<p>It has been a refreshment to many nice consciences to know
that our Chief Magistrate would not regard with eyes of approval
the (by many esteemed) sinful pastime of dancing, and
I own myself to be so far of that mind, that I could not but
set my face against this Mexican Polka, though danced to the
Presidential piping with a Gubernatorial second. If ever the
country should be seized with another such mania <i>de propagand&acirc;
fide</i>, I think it would be wise to fill our bombshells with
alternate copies of the Cambridge Platform and the Thirty-nine
Articles, which would produce a mixture of the highest
explosive power, and to wrap every one of our cannon-balls in
a leaf of the New Testament, the reading of which is denied
to those who sit in the darkness of Popery. Those iron evangelists
would thus be able to disseminate vital religion and
Gospel truth in quarters inaccessible to the ordinary missionary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
I have seen lads, unimpregnate with the more sublimated
punctiliousness of Walton, secure pickerel, taking
their unwary <i>siesta</i> beneath the lily-pads too nigh the surface,
with a gun and small shot. Why not, then, since gunpowder
was unknown to the apostles (not to enter here upon the
question whether it were discovered before that period by the
Chinese), suit our metaphor to the age in which we live, and
say <i>shooters</i> as well as <i>fishers</i> of men?</p>

<p>I do much fear that we shall be seized now and then with a
Protestant fervour, as long as we have neighbour Naboths whose
wallowings in Papistical mire excite our horror in exact proportion
to the size and desirableness of their vineyards. Yet
I rejoice that some earnest Protestants have been made by this
war,&mdash;I mean those who protested against it. Fewer they
were than I could wish, for one might imagine America to
have been colonized by a tribe of those nondescript African
animals the Aye-Ayes, so difficult a word is <i>No</i> to us all.
There is some malformation or defect of the vocal organs,
which either prevents our uttering it at all, or gives it so thick
a pronunciation as to be unintelligible. A mouth filled with
the national pudding, or watering in expectation thereof, is
wholly incompetent to this refractory monosyllable. An abject
and herpetic Public Opinion is the Pope, the Anti-Christ, for
us to protest against <i>e corde cordium</i>. And by what College
of Cardinals is this our God's-vicar, our binder and looser,
elected? Very like, by the sacred conclave of Tag, Rag, and
Bobtail, the gracious atmosphere of the grog-shop. Yet it
is of this that we must all be puppets. This thumps the
pulpit-cushion, this guides the editor's pen, this wags the
senator's tongue. This decides what Scriptures are canonical,
and shuffles Christ away into the Apocrypha. According to
that sentence fathered upon Solon, <span title="Hout&ocirc; d&ecirc;mosion kakon erchetai oikad' hekast&ocirc;">&#927;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#948;&#951;&#956;&#8057;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#7956;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#7988;&#954;&#945;&#948;' &#7953;&#954;&#8049;&#963;&#964;&#8179;</span>.
This unclean spirit is skilful to assume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
various shapes. I have known it to enter my own study and
nudge my elbow of a Saturday, under the semblance of a
wealthy member of my congregation. It were a great blessing,
if every particular of what in the sum we call popular
sentiment could carry about the name of its manufacturer
stamped legibly upon it. I gave a stab under the fifth rib to
that pestilent fallacy,&mdash;"Our country, right or wrong,"&mdash;by
tracing its original to a speech of Ensign Cilley at a dinner of
the Bungtown Fencibles.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<h3>WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS.</h3>



<div class="hw"><p>[A few remarks on the following verses will not be out of
place. The satire in them was not meant to have any personal,
but only a general, application. Of the gentleman upon whose
letter they were intended as a commentary Mr. Biglow had
never heard, till he saw the letter itself. The position of the
satirist is oftentimes one which he would not have chosen had
the election been left to himself. In attacking bad principles,
he is obliged to select some individual who has made himself
their exponent, and in whom they are impersonate, to the end
that what he says may not, through ambiguity, be dissipated
<i>tenues in auras</i>. For what says Seneca? <i>Longum iter per
pr&aelig;cepta, breve et efficace per exempla.</i> A bad principle is
comparatively harmless while it continues to be an abstraction,
nor can the general mind comprehend it fully till it is printed
in that large type which all men can read at sight, namely, the
life and character, the sayings and doings, of particular persons.
It is one of the cunningest fetches of Satan, that he never exposes
himself directly to our arrows, but, still dodging behind
this neighbour or that acquaintance, compels us to wound
him through them, if at all. He holds our affections as
hostages, the while he patches up a truce with our conscience.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let us not forget that the aim of the true satirist
is not to be severe upon persons, but only upon falsehood: and,
as Truth and Falsehood start from the same point, and sometimes
even go along together for a little way, his business is to
follow the path of the latter after it diverges, and to show her
floundering in the bog at the end of it. Truth is quite beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the reach of satire. There is so brave a simplicity in her, that
she can no more be made ridiculous than an oak or a pine.
The danger of the satirist is, that continual use may deaden
his sensibility to the force of language. He becomes more and
more liable to strike harder than he knows or intends. He
may be careful to put on his boxing-gloves, and yet forget,
that, the older they grow, the more plainly may the knuckles
inside be felt. Moreover, in the heat of contest, the eye is
insensibly drawn to the crown of victory, whose tawdry tinsel
glitters through that dust of the ring which obscures Truth's
wreath of simple leaves. I have sometimes thought that my
young friend, Mr. Biglow, needed a monitory hand laid on his
arm,&mdash;<i>aliquid sufflaminandus erat</i>. I have never thought it
good husbandry to water the tender plants of reform with <i>aqua
fortis</i>, yet, where so much is to do in the beds, he were a sorry
gardener who should wage a whole day's war with an iron
scuffle on those ill weeds that make the garden-walks of life
unsightly, when a sprinkle of Attic salt will wither them up.
<i>Est ars etiam maledicendi</i>, says Scaliger, and truly it is a hard
thing to say where the graceful gentleness of the lamb merges
in downright sheepishness. We may conclude with worthy
and wise Dr. Fuller, that "one may be a lamb in private
wrongs, but in hearing general affronts to goodness they are
asses which are not lions."&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<div class="hw"><p>[The attentive reader will doubtless have perceived in the
foregoing poem an allusion to that pernicious sentiment,&mdash;"Our
country, right or wrong." It is an abuse of language to call
a certain portion of land much more certain personages
elevated for the time being to high station, our country. I
would not sever nor loosen a single one of those ties by which
we are united to the spot of our birth, nor minish by a tittle
the respect due to the Magistrate. I love our own Bay State
too well to do the one, and as for the other, I have myself for
nigh forty years exercised, however unworthily, the function
of Justice of the Peace, having been called thereto by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
unsolicited kindness of that most excellent man and upright
patriot, Caleb Strong. <i>Patri&aelig; fumus igne alieno luculentior</i> is
best qualified with this,&mdash;<i>Ubi libertas, ibi patria</i>. We are inhabitants
of two worlds, and owe a double, but not a divided,
allegiance. In virtue of our clay, this little ball of earth exacts
a certain loyalty of us; while, in our capacity as spirits, we are
admitted citizens of an invisible and holier fatherland. There
is a patriotism of the soul whose claim absolves us from our
other and terrene fealty. Our true country is that ideal realm
which we represent to ourselves under the names of religion,
duty, and the like. Our terrestrial organizations are but far-off
approaches to so fair a model, and all they are verily
traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this
their original intendment. When, therefore, one would have
us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitude,&mdash;"<i>Our
country, however bounded!</i>" he demands of us that we sacrifice
the larger to the less, the higher to the lower, and that we
yield to the imaginary claims of a few acres of soil our duty
and privilege as liegemen of Truth. Our true country is
bounded on the north and the south, on the east and the west,
by Justice, and when she oversteps that invisible boundary-line
by so much as a hair's-breadth, she ceases to be our
mother, and chooses rather to be looked upon <i>quasi noverca</i>.
That is a hard choice, when our earthly love of country calls
upon us to tread one path and our duty points us to another.
We must make as noble and becoming an election as did
Penelope between Icarius and Ulysses. Veiling our faces, we
must take silently the hand of Duty to follow her.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of the foregoing poem, there
appeared some comments upon it in one of the public prints
which seemed to call for some animadversion. I accordingly
addressed to Mr. Buckingham, of the <i>Boston Courier</i>, the following
letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p class="date2">"<span class="smcap">Jaalam</span>, November 4, 1847.</p>

<p>"<i>To the Editor of the Courier:</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Respected Sir</span>,&mdash;Calling at the post-office this morning,
our worthy and efficient postmaster offered for my perusal a
paragraph in the Boston Morning Post of the 3d instant,
wherein certain effusions of the pastoral muse are attributed
to the pen of Mr. James Russell Lowell. For ought I know
or can affirm to the contrary, this Mr. Lowell may be a very
deserving person and a youth of parts (though I have seen
verses of his which I could never rightly understand); and if
he be such, he, I am certain, as well as I, would be free from
any proclivity to appropriate to himself whatever of credit (or
discredit) may honestly belong to another. I am confident,
that, in penning these few lines, I am only forestalling a disclaimer
from that young gentleman, whose silence hitherto,
when rumour pointed to himward, has excited in my bosom
mingled emotions of sorrow and surprise. Well may my
young parishioner, Mr. Biglow, exclaim with the poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Sic vos non vobis' &amp;c.;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>though, in saying this, I would not convey the impression that
he is a proficient in the Latin tongue,&mdash;the tongue, I might
add, of a Horace and a Tully.</p>

<p>"Mr. B. does not employ his pen, I can safely say, for any
lucre of worldly gain, or to be exalted by the carnal plaudits of
men, <i>digito monstrari</i>, &amp;c. He does not wait upon Providence
for mercies, and in his heart mean <i>merces</i>. But I should
esteem myself as verily deficient in my duty (who am his friend
and in some unworthy sort his spiritual <i>fidus Achates</i>, &amp;c.), if
I did not step forward to claim for him whatever measure of
applause might be assigned to him by the judicious.</p>

<p>"If this were a fitting occasion, I might venture here a brief
dissertation touching the manner and kind of my young friend's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
poetry. But I dubitate whether this abstruser sort of speculation
(though enlivened by some apposite instances from Aristophanes)
would sufficiently interest your oppidan readers.
As regards their satirical tone, and their plainness of speech,
I will only say, that, in my pastoral experience, I have found
that the Arch-Enemy loves nothing better than to be treated
as a religious, moral, and intellectual being, and that there is no
<i>apage Sathanas</i>! so potent as ridicule. But it is a kind of weapon
that must have a button of good-nature on the point of it.</p>

<p>"The productions of Mr. B. have been stigmatized in some
quarters as unpatriotic; but I can vouch that he loves his
native soil with that hearty, though discriminating, attachment
which springs from an intimate social intercourse of many
years' standing. In the ploughing season, no one has a deeper
share in the well-being of the country than he. If Dean Swift
were right in saying that he who makes two blades of grass grow
where one grew before confers a greater benefit on the state
than he who taketh a city, Mr. B. might exhibit a fairer claim
to the Presidency than General Scott himself. I think that
some of those disinterested lovers of the hard-handed democracy,
whose fingers have never touched anything rougher
than the dollars of our common country, would hesitate to
compare palms with him. It would do your heart good, respected
Sir, to see that young man now. He cuts a cleaner
and wider swarth than any in this town.</p>

<p>"But it is time for me to be at my Post. It is very clear
that my young friend's shot has struck the lintel, for the Post
is shaken (Amos ix. 1). The editor of that paper is a strenuous
advocate of the Mexican war, and a colonel, as I am given
to understand. I presume, that, being necessarily absent in
Mexico, he has left his journal in some less judicious hands.
At any rate, the Post has been too swift on this occasion. It
could hardly have cited a more incontrovertible line from any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
poem than that which it has selected for animadversion,
namely,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'We kind o' thought Christ went agin war an' pillage.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"If the Post maintains the converse of this proposition, it
can hardly be considered as a safe guide-post for the moral and
religious portions of its party, however many other excellent
qualities of a post it may be blessed with. There is a sign in
London on which is painted,&mdash;'The Green Man.' It would
do very well as a portrait of any individual who would support
so unscriptural a thesis. As regards the language of the line
in question, I am bold to say that He who readeth the hearts
of men will not account any dialect unseemly which conveys
a sound and pious sentiment. I could wish that such sentiments
were more common, however uncouthly expressed.
Saint Ambrose affirms, that <i>veritas a quocunque</i> (why not, then
<i>quomodocunque</i>?) <i>dicatur, a spiritu sancto est</i>. Digest also this
of Baxter:&mdash;'The plainest words are the most profitable
oratory in weightiest matters.'</p>

<p>"When the paragraph in question was shown to Mr. Biglow,
the only part of it which seemed to give him any dissatisfaction
was that which classed him with the Whig party. He says,
that, if resolutions are a nourishing kind of diet, that party
must be in a very hearty and flourishing condition; for that
they have quietly eaten more good ones of their own baking
than he could have conceived to be possible without repletion.
He has been for some years past (I regret to say) an ardent
opponent of those sound doctrines of protective policy which
form so prominent a portion of the creed of that party. I
confess, that, in some discussions which I have had with him
on this point in my study, he has displayed a vein of obstinacy
which I had not hitherto detected in his composition. He is
also (<i>horresco referens</i>) infected in no small measure with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
peculiar notions of a print called the Liberator, whose heresies
I take every proper opportunity of combating, and of which,
I thank God, I have never read a single line.</p>

<p>"I did not see Mr. B.'s verses until they appeared in print,
and there <i>is</i> certainly one thing in them which I consider
highly improper. I allude to the personal references to myself
by name. To confer notoriety on an humble individual who is
labouring quietly in his vocation, and who keeps his cloth as
free as he can from the dust of the political arena (though <i>v&aelig;
mihi si non evangelizavero</i>), is no doubt an indecorum. The
sentiments which he attributes to me I will not deny to be
mine. They were embodied, though in a different form, in a
discourse preached upon the last day of public fasting, and
were acceptable to my entire people (of whatever political
views), except the postmaster, who dissented <i>ex officio</i>. I
observe that you sometimes devote a portion of your paper to
a religious summary. I should be well pleased to furnish a
copy of my discourse for insertion in this department of your
instructive journal. By omitting the advertisements, it might
easily be got within the limits of a single number, and I
venture to insure you the sale of some scores of copies in this
town. I will cheerfully render myself responsible for ten. It
might possibly be advantageous to issue it as an <i>extra</i>. But
perhaps you will not esteem it an object, and I will not press
it. My offer does not spring from any weak desire of seeing
my name in print; for I can enjoy this satisfaction at any time
by turning to the Triennial Catalogue of the University, where
it also possesses that added emphasis of Italics with which
those of my calling are distinguished.</p>

<p>"I would simply add, that I continue to fit ingenuous
youth for college, and that I have two spacious and airy
sleeping apartments at this moment unoccupied. <i>Ingenuas
didicisse</i>, &amp;c. Terms, which vary according to the circumstances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the parents, may be known on application to me by letter,
post paid. In all cases the lad will be expected to fetch his
own towels. This rule, Mrs. W. desires me to add, has no
exceptions.</p>

<p class="sign1">"Respectfully, your obedient servant,<br />
"HOMER WILBUR, A.M.</p>

<p>"P.S. Perhaps the last paragraph may look like an attempt
to obtain the insertion of my circular gratuitously. If it should
appear to you in that light, I desire that you would erase it, or
charge for it at the usual rates, and deduct the amount from
the proceeds in your hands from the sale of my discourse, when
it shall be printed. My circular is much longer and more explicit,
and will be forwarded without charge to any who may
desire it. It has been very neatly executed on a letter sheet,
by a very deserving printer, who attends upon my ministry,
and is a creditable specimen of the typographic art. I have
one hung over my mantelpiece in a neat frame, where it makes
a beautiful and appropriate ornament, and balances the profile
of Mrs. W., cut with her toes by the young lady born without
arms.</p>

<p class="ralign">H. W."</p>

<p>I have in the foregoing letter mentioned General Scott in
connexion with the Presidency, because I have been given to
understand that he has blown to pieces and otherwise caused
to be destroyed more Mexicans than any other commander.
His claim would therefore be deservedly considered the
strongest. Until accurate returns of the Mexican killed,
wounded, and maimed be obtained, it would be difficult to
settle these nice points of precedence. Should it prove that
any other officer has been more meritorious and destructive
than General. S., and has thereby rendered himself more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
worthy of the confidence and support of the conservative
portion of our community, I shall cheerfully insert his name,
instead of that of General S., in a future edition. It may be
thought, likewise, that General S. has invalidated his claims
by too much attention to the decencies of apparel, and the
habits belonging to a gentleman. These abstruser points of
statesmanship are beyond my scope. I wonder not that
successful military achievement should attract the admiration
of the multitude. Rather do I rejoice with wonder to behold
how rapidly this sentiment is losing its hold upon the popular
mind. It is related of Thomas Warton, the second of that
honoured name who held the office of Poetry Professor at
Oxford, that, when one wished to find him, being absconded,
as was his wont, in some obscure alehouse, he was counselled
to traverse the city with a drum and fife, the sound of which
inspiring music would be sure to draw the Doctor from his
retirement into the street. We are all more or less bitten
with this martial insanity. <i>Nescio qu&acirc; dulcedine ...
cunctos ducit.</i> I confess to some infection of that itch myself.
When I see a Brigadier-General maintaining his insecure
elevation in the saddle under the severe fire of the training-field,
and when I remember that some military enthusiasts,
through haste, inexperience, or an over-desire to lend reality
to those fictitious combats, will sometimes discharge their
ramrods, I cannot but admire, while I deplore, the mistaken
devotion of those heroic officers. <i>Semel insanivimus omnes.</i> I
was myself, during the late war with Great Britain, chaplain
of a regiment, which was fortunately never called to active
military duty. I mention this circumstance with regret rather
than pride. Had I been summoned to actual warfare, I trust
that I might have been strengthened to bear myself after the
manner of that reverend father in our New England Israel, Dr.
Benjamin Colman, who, as we are told in Turell's life of him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
when the vessel in which he had taken passage for England
was attacked by a French privateer, "fought like a philosopher
and a Christian, ... and prayed all the while he charged
and fired." As this note is already long, I shall not here enter
upon a discussion of the question, whether Christians may
lawfully be soldiers. I think it sufficiently evident, that,
during the first two centuries of the Christian era, at least,
the two professions were esteemed incompatible. Consult
Jortin on this head.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<p class="hdtt">REMARKS OF INCREASE D. O'PHACE, ESQUIRE, AT AN EX-TRUMPERY
CAUCUS IN STATE STREET, REPORTED BY MR. H. BIGLOW.</p>


<div class="hw"><p>[The ingenious reader will at once understand that no such
speech as the following was ever <i>totidem verbis</i> pronounced.
But there are simpler and less guarded wits, for the satisfying
of which such an explanation may be needful. For there are
certain invisible lines, which as Truth successively overpasses,
she becomes Untruth to one and another of us, as a large
river, flowing from one kingdom into another, sometimes takes
a new name, albeit the waters undergo no change, how small
soever. There is, moreover, a truth of fiction more veracious
than the truth of fact, as that of the Poet, which represents to
us things and events as they ought to be, rather than servilely
copies them as they are imperfectly imaged in the crooked and
smoky glass of our mundane affairs. It is this which makes
the speech of Antonius, though originally spoken in no wider
a forum than the brain of Shakspeare, more historically valuable
than that other which Appian has reported, by as much
as the understanding of the Englishman was more comprehensive
than that of the Alexandrian. Mr. Biglow, in the present
instance, has only made use of a licence assumed by all the
historians of antiquity, who put into the mouths of various
characters such words as seem to them most fitting to the
occasion and to the speaker. If it be objected that no such
oration could ever have been delivered, I answer, that there
are few assemblages for speech-making which do not better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
deserve the title of <i>Parliamentum Indoctorum</i> than did the
sixth Parliament of Henry the Fourth, and that men still continue
to have as much faith in the Oracle of Fools as ever
Pantagruel had. Howell, in his letters, recounts a merry tale
of a certain ambassador of Queen Elizabeth, who, having
written two letters, one to her Majesty and the other to his
wife, directed them at cross-purposes, so that the Queen was
beducked and bedeared and requested to send a change of hose,
and the wife was beprincessed and otherwise unwontedly besuperlatived,
till the one feared for the wits of her ambassador,
the other for those of her husband. In like manner it may be
presumed that our speaker has misdirected some of his thoughts,
and given to the whole theatre what he would have wished to
confide only to a select auditory at the back of the curtain.
For it is seldom that we can get any frank utterance from men,
who address, for the most part, a Buncombe either in this
world or the next. As for their audiences, it may be truly
said of our people, that they enjoy one political institution in
common with the ancient Athenians: I mean a certain profitless
kind of <i>ostracism</i>, wherewith, nevertheless, they seem
hitherto well enough content. For in Presidential elections,
and other affairs of the sort, whereas I observe that the <i>oysters</i>
fall to the lot of comparatively few, the <i>shells</i> (such as the privileges
of voting as they are told to do by the <i>ostrivori</i> aforesaid,
and of huzzaing at public meetings) are very liberally
distributed among the people, as being their prescriptive and
quite sufficient portion.</p>

<p>The occasion of the speech is supposed to be Mr. Palfrey's
refusal to vote for the Whig candidate for the Speakership.&mdash;H. W.]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="hw"><p>[Into the question, whether the ability to express ourselves
in articulate language has been productive of more good or
evil, I shall not here enter at large. The two faculties of
speech and of speech-making are wholly diverse in their
natures. By the first we make ourselves intelligible, by the
last unintelligible, to our fellows. It has not seldom occurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to me (noting how in our national legislature everything runs
to talk, as lettuces, if the season or the soil be unpropitious,
shoot up lankly to seed, instead of forming handsome heads)
that Babel was the first Congress, the earliest mill erected for
the manufacture of gabble. In these days, what with Town
Meetings, School Committees, Boards (lumber) of one kind
and another, Congresses, Parliaments, Diets, Indian Councils,
Palavers, and the like, there is scarce a village which has not
its factories of this description driven by (milk-and-) water
power. I cannot conceive the confusion of tongues to have
been the curse of Babel, since I esteem my ignorance of other
languages as a kind of Martello-tower, in which I am safe
from the furious bombardments of foreign garrulity. For this
reason I have ever preferred the study of the dead languages,
those primitive formations being Ararats upon whose silent
peaks I sit secure and watch this new deluge without fear,
though it rain figures (<i>simulacra</i>, semblances) of speech forty
days and nights together, as it not uncommonly happens. Thus
is my coat, as it were, without buttons by which any but a
vernacular wild bore can seize me. Is it not possible that the
Shakers may intend to convey a quiet reproof and hint, in
fastening their outer garments with hooks and eyes?</p>

<p>This reflection concerning Babel, which I find in no Commentary,
was first thrown upon my mind when an excellent
deacon of my congregation (being infected with the Second
Advent delusion) assured me that he had received a first
instalment of the gift of tongues as a small earnest of larger
possessions in the like kind to follow. For, of a truth, I could
not reconcile it with my ideas of the Divine justice and mercy
that the single wall which protected people of other languages
from the incursions of this otherwise well-meaning propagandist
should be broken down.</p>

<p>In reading Congressional debates, I have fancied, that, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the subsidence of those painful buzzings in the brain which
result from such exercises, I detected a slender residuum of
valuable information. I made the discovery that <i>nothing</i> takes
longer in the saying than anything else, for, as <i>ex nihilo nihil
fit</i>, so from one polypus <i>nothing</i> any number of similar ones
may be produced. I would recommend to the attention of
<i>viv&acirc; voce</i> debaters and controversialists the admirable example
of the monk Copres, who, in the fourth century, stood for half
an hour in the midst of a great fire, and thereby silenced a
Manich&aelig;an antagonist who had less of the salamander in
him. As for those who quarrel in print, I have no concern
with them here, since the eyelids are a Divinely-granted shield
against all such. Moreover, I have observed in many modern
books that the printed portion is becoming gradually smaller,
and the number of blank or fly-leaves (as they are called)
greater. Should this fortunate tendency of literature continue,
books will grow more valuable from year to year, and
the whole Serbonian bog yield to the advances of firm arable
land.</p>

<p>I have wondered, in the Representatives' Chamber of our
own Commonwealth, to mark how little impression seemed to
be produced by that emblematic fish suspended over the heads
of the members. Our wiser ancestors, no doubt, hung it there
as being the animal which the Pythagoreans reverenced for its
silence, and which certainly in that particular does not so well
merit the epithet <i>cold-blooded</i>, by which naturalists distinguish
it, as certain bipeds, afflicted with ditch-water on the brain,
who take occasion to tap themselves in Fanueil Halls, meeting-houses,
and other places of public resort.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<h3>THE DEBATE IN THE SENNIT</h3>

<p class="hdttc">SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME.</p>



<div class="hw"><p>[The incident which gave rise to the debate satirized in the
following verses was the unsuccessful attempt of Drayton and
Sayres to give freedom to seventy men and women, fellow-beings
and fellow-Christians. Had Tripoli, instead of Washington,
been the scene of this undertaking, the unhappy leaders
in it would have been as secure of the theoretic as they
now are of the practical part of martyrdom. I question
whether the Dey of Tripoli is blessed with a District Attorney
so benighted as ours at the seat of government. Very fitly is
he named Key, who would allow himself to be made the
instrument of locking the door of hope against sufferers in
such a cause. Not all the waters of the ocean can cleanse
the vile smutch of the jailer's fingers from off that little Key.
<i>Ahenea clavis</i>, a brazen Key indeed!</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun, who is made the chief speaker in this burlesque,
seems to think that the light of the nineteenth century
is to be put out as soon as he tinkles his little cow-bell curfew.
Whenever slavery is touched, he sets up his scarecrow of
dissolving the Union. This may do for the North, but I
should conjecture that something more than a pumpkin-lantern
is required to scare manifest and irretrievable Destiny out of
her path. Mr. Calhoun cannot let go the apron-string of the
Past. The Past is a good nurse, but we must be weaned from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
her sooner or later, even though, like Plotinus, we should run
home from school to ask the breast, after we are tolerably
well-grown youths. It will not do for us to hide our faces in
her lap, whenever the strange Future holds out her arms and
asks us to come to her.</p>

<p>But we are all alike. We have all heard it said, often
enough, that little boys must not play with fire; and yet, if
the matches be taken away from us and put out of reach upon
the shelf, we must needs get into our little corner, and scowl
and stamp and threaten the dire revenge of going to bed
without our supper. The world shall stop till we get our
dangerous plaything again. Dame Earth, meanwhile, who has
more than enough household matters to mind, goes bustling
hither and thither as a hiss or a sputter tells her that this
or that kettle of hers is boiling over, and before bedtime we
are glad to eat our porridge cold, and gulp down our dignity
along with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun has somehow acquired the name of a great
statesman, and, if it be great statesmanship to put lance in
rest and run a tilt at the Spirit of the Age with the certainty
of being next moment hurled neck and heels into the dust
amid universal laughter, he deserves the title. He is the Sir
Kay of our modern chivalry. He should remember the old
Scandinavian mythus. Thor was the strongest of gods, but
he could not wrestle with Time, nor so much as lift up a fold
of the great snake which knit the universe together; and when
he smote the Earth, though with his terrible mallet, it was but
as if a leaf had fallen. Yet all the while it seemed to Thor
that he had only been wrestling with an old woman, striving
to lift a cat, and striking a stupid giant on the head.</p>

<p>And in old times, doubtless, the giants <i>were</i> stupid, and
there was no better sport for the Sir Launcelots and Sir
Gawains than to go about cutting off their great blundering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
heads with enchanted swords. But things have wonderfully
changed. It is the giants, now-a-days, that have the science
and the intelligence, while the chivalrous Don Quixotes of
Conservatism still cumber themselves with the clumsy armour
of a by-gone age. On whirls the restless globe through unsounded
time, with its cities and its silences, its births and
funerals, half light, half shade, but never wholly dark, and
sure to swing round into the happy morning at last. With
an involuntary smile, one sees Mr. Calhoun letting slip his
pack-thread cable with a crooked pin at the end of it to
anchor South Carolina upon the bank and shoal of the Past.&mdash;H. W.]</p>

<div class="hw"><p>[It was said of old time, that riches have wings; and, though
this be not applicable in a literal strictness to the wealth of
our patriarchal brethren of the South, yet it is clear that their
possessions have legs, and an unaccountable propensity for
using them in a northerly direction. I marvel that the grand
jury of Washington did not find a true bill against the North
Star for aiding and abetting Drayton and Sayres. It would
have been quite of a piece with the intelligence displayed by
the South on other questions connected with slavery. I think
that no ship of state was ever freighted with a more veritable
Jonah than this same domestic institution of ours. Mephistopheles
himself could not feign so bitterly, so satirically sad a
sight as this of three millions of human beings crushed beyond
help or hope by this one mighty argument,&mdash;<i>Our fathers knew
no better!</i> Nevertheless, it is the unavoidable destiny of
Jonahs to be cast overboard sooner or later. Or shall we try
the experiment of hiding our Jonah in a safe place, that none
may lay hands on him to make jetsam of him? Let us, then,
with equal forethought and wisdom, lash ourselves to the anchor,
and await, in pious confidence, the certain result. Perhaps
our suspicious passenger is no Jonah after all, being
black. For it is well known that a superintending Providence
made a kind of sandwich of Ham and his descendants, to be
devoured by the Caucasian race.</p>

<p>In God's name, let all, who hear nearer and nearer the
hungry moan of the storm and the growl of the breakers,
speak out! But, alas! we have no right to interfere. If a
man pluck an apple of mine, he shall be in danger of the
justice; but if he steal my brother, I must be silent. Who
says this? Our Constitution, consecrated by the callous
suetude of sixty years, and grasped in triumphant argument
in the left hand of him whose right hand clutches the clotted
slave-whip. Justice, venerable with the undethronable majesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of countless &aelig;ons, says,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Speak</span>! The Past, wise with the
sorrows and desolations of ages, from amid her shattered fanes
and wolf-housing palaces, echoes,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Speak</span>! Nature, through
her thousand trumpets of freedom, her stars, her sunrises, her
seas, her winds, her cataracts, her mountains blue with cloudy
pines, blows jubilant encouragement, and cries,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Speak</span>!
From the soul's trembling abysses the still, small voice not
vaguely murmurs,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Speak</span>! But, alas! the Constitution and
the Honourable Mr. Bagowind, M.C., say,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Be dumb</span>!</p>

<p>It occurs to me to suggest, as a topic of inquiry in this connexion,
whether, on that momentous occasion when the goats
and the sheep shall be parted, the Constitution and the Honourable
Mr. Bagowind, M.C., will be expected to take their
places on the left as our hircine vicars.</p>

<p>There is a point where toleration sinks into sheer baseness and
poltroonery. The toleration of the worst leads us to look on
what is barely better as good enough, and to worship what is
only moderately good. Woe to that man, or that nation, to
whom mediocrity has become an ideal!</p>

<p>Has our experiment of self-government succeeded, if it barely
manage to <i>rub and go</i>? Here, now, is a piece of barbarism
which Christ and the nineteenth century say shall cease, and
which Messrs. Smith, Brown, and others say shall <i>not</i> cease.
I would by no means deny the eminent respectability of these
gentlemen, but I confess, that, in such a wrestling-match, I
cannot help having my fears for them.</p>

<h3>THE PIOUS EDITOR'S CREED.</h3>



<div class="hw"><p>[At the special instance of Mr. Biglow, I preface the following
satire with an extract from a sermon preached during
the past summer, from Ezekiel xxxiv. 2:&mdash;"Son of man, prophesy
against the shepherds of Israel." Since the Sabbath on
which this discourse was delivered, the editor of the "Jaalam
Independent Blunderbuss" has unaccountably absented himself
from our house of worship.</p>

<p>"I know of no so responsible position as that of the public
journalist. The editor of our day bears the same relation to
his time that the clerk bore to the age before the invention of
printing. Indeed, the position which he holds is that which
the clergyman should hold even now. But the clergyman
chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world, and to
throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness which
he calls the Next Life. As if <i>next</i> did not mean <i>nearest</i>, and as
if any life were nearer than that immediately present one which
boils and eddies all around him at the caucus, the ratification
meeting, and the polls! Who taught him to exhort men to
prepare for eternity, as for some future era of which the
present forms no integral part? The furrow which Time is
even now turning runs through the Everlasting, and in that
must he plant or nowhere. Yet he would fain believe and
teach that we are <i>going</i> to have more of eternity than we have
now. This <i>going</i> of his is like that of the auctioneer, on which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
<i>gone</i> follows before we have made up our minds to bid,&mdash;in
which manner, not three months back, I lost an excellent copy
of Chappelow on Job. So it has come to pass that the
preacher, instead of being a living force, has faded into an
emblematic figure at christenings, weddings, and funerals.
Or, if he exercise any other function, it is as keeper and feeder
of certain theologic dogmas, which, when occasion offers, he
unkennels with a <i>staboy!</i> 'to bark and bite as 'tis their nature
to,' whence that reproach of <i>odium theologicum</i> has arisen.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, see what a pulpit the editor mounts daily,
sometimes with a congregation of fifty thousand within reach
of his voice, and never so much as a nodder, even, among
them! And from what a Bible can he choose his text,&mdash;a
Bible which needs no translation, and which no priestcraft can
shut and clasp from the laity,&mdash;the open volume of the world,
upon which, with a pen of sunshine or destroying fire, the
inspired Present is even now writing the annals of God!
Methinks the editor who should understand his calling, and be
equal thereto, would truly deserve that title of <span title="poim&ecirc;n la&ocirc;n">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#951;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#8182;&#957;</span>,
which Homer bestows upon princes. He would be the Moses
of our nineteenth century; and whereas the old Sinai, silent
now, is but a common mountain, stared at by the elegant
tourist and crawled over by the hammering geologist, he must
find his tables of the new law here among factories and cities
in this Wilderness of Sin (Numbers xxxiii. 12) called Progress
of Civilization, and be the captain of our Exodus into the
Canaan of a truer social order.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, our editor will not come so far within even
the shadow of Sinai as Mahomet did, but chooses rather to
construe Moses by Joe Smith. He takes up the crook, not
that the sheep may be fed, but that he may never want a
warm woollen suit and a joint of mutton.</p>

<p>For which reason I would derive the name <i>editor</i> not so much
from <i>edo</i>, to publish, as from <i>edo</i>, to eat, that being the
peculiar profession to which he esteems himself called. He
blows up the flames of political discord for no other occasion
than that he may thereby handily boil his own pot. I believe
there are two thousand of these mutton-loving shepherds in
the United States; and of these, how many have even the
dimmest perception of their immense power, and the duties
consequent thereon? Here and there, haply, one. Nine
hundred and ninety-nine labour to impress upon the people the
great principles of <i>Tweedledum</i>, and other nine hundred and
ninety-nine preach with equal earnestness the gospel according
to <i>Tweedledee</i>."&mdash;H. W.]</p>

<div class="hw"><p>[I subjoin here another passage from my before-mentioned
discourse.</p>

<p>"Wonderful, to him that has eyes to see it rightly, is the
newspaper. To me, for example, sitting on the critical front
bench of the pit, in my study here in Jaalam, the advent of my
weekly journal is as that of a strolling theatre, or rather of a
puppet-show, on whose stage, narrow as it is, the tragedy,
comedy, and farce of life are played in little. Behold the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
whole huge earth sent to me hebdomadally in a brown-paper
wrapper!</p>

<p>"Hither, to my obscure corner, by wind or steam, on horse-back
or dromedary-back, in the pouch of the Indian runner, or
clicking over the magnetic wires, troop all the famous performers
from the four quarters of the globe. Looked at from
a point of criticism, tiny puppets they seem all, as the editor
sets up his booth upon my desk and officiates as showman.
Now I can truly see how little and transitory is life. The
earth appears almost as a drop of vinegar, on which the solar
microscope of the imagination must be brought to bear in order
to make out any thing distinctly. That animalcule there, in
the pea-jacket, is Louis Philippe, just landed on the coast of
England. That other, in the grey surtout and cocked hat, is
Napoleon Bonaparte Smith, assuring France that she need
apprehend no interference from him in the present alarming
juncture. At that spot, where you seem to see a speck of
something in motion, is an immense mass-meeting. Look
sharper, and you will see a mite brandishing his mandibles in
an excited manner. That is the great Mr. Soandso, defining
his position amid tumultuous and irrepressible cheers. That
infinitesimal creature, upon whom some score of others, as
minute as he, are gazing in open-mouthed admiration, is a
famous philosopher, expounding to a select audience their
capacity for the Infinite. That scarce discernible pufflet of
smoke and dust is a revolution. That speck there is a reformer,
just arranging the lever with which he is to move the world.
And lo, there creeps forward the shadow of a skeleton that
blows one breath between its grinning teeth, and all our distinguished
actors are whisked off the slippery stage into the
dark Beyond.</p>

<p>"Yes, the little show-box has its solemner suggestions.
Now and then we catch a glimpse of a grim old man, who lays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
down a scythe and hour-glass in the corner while he shifts the
scenes. There, too, in the dim background, a weird shape is
ever delving. Sometimes he leans upon his mattock, and gazes,
as a coach whirls by, bearing the newly married on their wedding
jaunt, or glances carelessly at a babe brought home from
christening. Suddenly (for the scene grows larger and larger
as we look) a bony hand snatches back a performer in the
midst of his part, and him, whom yesterday two infinities (past
and future) would not suffice, a handful of dust is enough to
cover and silence for ever. Nay, we see the same fleshless
fingers opening to clutch the showman himself, and guess, not
without a shudder, that they are lying in wait for spectator
also.</p>

<p>"Think of it: for three dollars a year I buy a season-ticket
to this great Globe Theatre, for which God would write
the dramas (only that we like farces, spectacles, and the
tragedies of Apollyon better), whose scene-shifter is Time, and
whose curtain is rung down by Death.</p>

<p>"Such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as I am tearing
off the wrapper of my newspaper. Then suddenly that otherwise
too often vacant sheet becomes invested for me with a
strange kind of awe. Look! deaths and marriages, notices of
inventions, discoveries, and books, lists of promotions, of killed,
wounded, and missing, news of fires, accidents, of sudden
wealth and as sudden poverty;&mdash;I hold in my hand the ends
of myriad invisible electric conductors, along which tremble
the joys, sorrows, wrongs, triumphs, hopes, and despairs of as
many men and women everywhere. So that upon that mood
of mind which seems to isolate me from mankind as a spectator
of their puppet-pranks, another supervenes, in which I feel
that I, too, unknown and unheard of, am yet of some import
to my fellows. For, through my newspaper here, do not
families take pains to send me, an entire stranger, news of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
death among them? Are not here two who would have me
know of their marriage? And strangest of all, is not this
singular person anxious to have me informed that he has
received a fresh supply of Dimitry Bruisgins? But to none
of us does the Present (even if for a moment discerned as such)
continue miraculous. We glance carelessly at the sunrise, and
get used to Orion and the Pleiades. The wonder wears off,
and to-morrow this sheet, in which a vision was let down to
me from Heaven, shall be the wrappage to a bar of soap or the
platter for a beggar's broken victuals."&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<h3>A LETTER</h3>

<p class="hdtt">FROM A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN ANSWER TO SUTTIN
QUESTIONS PROPOSED BY MR. HOSEA BIGLOW, INCLOSED IN
A NOTE FROM MR. BIGLOW TO S. H. GAY, ESQ., EDITOR OF
THE NATIONAL ANTISLAVERY STANDARD.</p>


<div class="hw"><p>[Curiosity may be said to be the quality which pre-eminently
distinguishes and segregates man from the lower animals. As
we trace the scale of animated nature downward, we find this
faculty of the mind (as it may truly be called) diminished in
the savage, and quite extinct in the brute. The first object
which civilized man proposes to himself I take to be the finding
out whatsoever he can concerning his neighbours. <i>Nihil
humanum a me alienum puto</i>; I am curious about even John
Smith. The desire next in strength to this (an opposite pole,
indeed, of the same magnet) is that of communicating intelligence.</p>

<p>Men in general may be divided into the inquisitive and the
communicative. To the first class belong Peeping Toms,
eaves-droppers, navel-contemplating Brahmins, metaphysicians,
travellers, Empedocleses, spies, the various societies for promoting
Rhinothism, Columbuses, Yankees, discoverers, and
men of science, who present themselves to the mind as so
many marks of interrogation wandering up and down the
world, or sitting in studies and laboratories. The second
class I should again subdivide into four. In the first subdivision
I would rank those who have an itch to tell us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
about themselves,&mdash;as keepers of diaries, insignificant persons
generally, Montaignes, Horace Walpoles, autobiographers,
poets. The second includes those who are anxious to impart
information concerning other people,&mdash;as historians, barbers,
and such. To the third belong those who labour to give us
intelligence about nothing at all,&mdash;as novelists, political
orators, the large majority of authors, preachers, lecturers,
and the like. In the fourth come those who are communicative
from motives of public benevolence,&mdash;as finders of mares'-nests
and bringers of ill news. Each of us two-legged fowls
without feathers embraces all these subdivisions in himself to
a greater or less degree, for none of us so much as lays an egg,
or incubates a chalk one, but straightway the whole barn-yard
shall know it by our cackle or our cluck. <i>Omnibus hoc vitium
est.</i> There are different grades in all these classes. One
will turn his telescope toward a back-yard, another toward
Uranus; one will tell you that he dined with Smith, another
that he supped with Plato. In one particular, all men may be
considered as belonging to the first grand division, inasmuch
as they all seem equally desirous of discovering the mote in
their neighbour's eye.</p>

<p>To one or another of these species every human being may
safely be referred. I think it beyond a peradventure that
Jonah prosecuted some inquiries into the digestive apparatus
of whales, and that Noah sealed up a letter in an empty bottle,
that news in regard to him might not be wanting in case of
the worst. They had else been super or subter human. I
conceive, also, that, as there are certain persons who continually
peep and pry at the key-hole of that mysterious door
through which, sooner or later, we all make our exits, so there
are doubtless ghosts fidgeting and fretting on the other side
of it, because they have no means of conveying back to the
world the scraps of news they have picked up. For there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
an answer ready somewhere to every question, the great law
of <i>give and take</i> runs through all nature, and if we see a hook,
we may be sure that an eye is waiting for it. I read in every
face I meet a standing advertisement of information wanted in
regard to A. B., or that the friends of C. D. can hear of him
by application to such a one.</p>

<p>It was to gratify the two great passions of asking and
answering, that epistolary correspondence was first invented.
Letters (for by this usurped title epistles are now commonly
known) are of several kinds. First, there are those which are
not letters at all,&mdash;as letters patent, letters dimissory, letters
inclosing bills, letters of administration, Pliny's letters, letters
of diplomacy, of Cato, of Mentor, of Lords Lyttelton, Chesterfield,
and Orrery, of Jacob Behmen, Seneca (whom St. Jerome
includes in his list of sacred writers), letters from abroad,
from sons in college to their fathers, letters of marque, and
letters generally, which are in no wise letters of mark.
Second, are real letters, such as those of Gray, Cowper, Walpole,
Howel, Lamb, the first letters from children (printed in
staggering capitals), Letters from New York, letters of credit,
and others, interesting for the sake of the writer or the thing
written. I have read also letters from Europe by a gentleman
named Pinto, containing some curious gossip, and which I
hope to see collected for the benefit of the curious. There are,
besides, letters addressed to posterity,&mdash;as epitaphs, for
example, written for their own monuments by monarchs,
whereby we have lately become possessed of the names of
several great conquerors and kings of kings, hitherto unheard
of and still unpronounceable, but valuable to the student of
the entirely dark ages. The letter which St. Peter sent to
King Pepin in the year of grace 755 I would place in a class
by itself, as also the letters of candidates, concerning which I
shall dilate more fully in a note at the end of the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
poem. At present, <i>sat prata biberunt</i>. Only, concerning the
shape of letters, they are all either square or oblong, to which
general figures circular letters and round-robins also conform
themselves.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<div class="hw"><p>[And now of epistles candidatial, which are of two kinds,&mdash;namely,
letters of acceptance, and letters definitive of position.
Our republic, on the eve of an election, may safely enough be
called a republic of letters. Epistolary composition becomes
then an epidemic, which seizes one candidate after another, not
seldom cutting short the thread of political life. It has come
to such a pass, that a party dreads less the attacks of its opponents
than a letter from its candidate. <i>Litera scripta manet</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and it will go hard if something bad cannot be made of it.
General Harrison, it is well understood, was surrounded, during
his candidacy, with the <i>cordon sanitaire</i> of a vigilance committee.
No prisoner in Spielberg was ever more cautiously
deprived of writing materials. The soot was scraped carefully
from the chimney-places; outposts of expert rifle-shooters
rendered it sure death for any goose (who came clad in feathers)
to approach within a certain limited distance of North
Bend; and all domestic fowls about the premises were reduced
to the condition of Plato's original man. By these precautions
the General was saved. <i>Parva componere magnis</i>, I remember,
that, when party-spirit once ran high among my people, upon
occasion of the choice of a new deacon, I, having my preferences,
yet not caring too openly to express them, made use of
an innocent fraud to bring about that result which I deemed
most desirable. My stratagem was no other than the throwing
a copy of the Complete Letter-Writer in the way of the candidate
whom I wished to defeat. He caught the infection,
and addressed a short note to his constituents, in which the
opposite party detected so many and so grave improprieties
(he had modeled it upon the letter of a young lady accepting
a proposal of marriage), that he not only lost his election, but,
falling under a suspicion of Sabellianism and I know not what
(the widow Endive assured me that he was a Paralipomenon,
to her certain knowledge), was forced to leave the town. Thus
it is that the letter killeth.</p>

<p>The object which candidates propose to themselves in writing
is to convey no meaning at all. And here is a quite unsuspected
pitfall into which they successively plunge headlong.
For it is precisely in such cryptographies that mankind are
prone to seek for and find a wonderful amount and variety of
significance. <i>Omne ignotum pro mirifico.</i> How do we admire
at the antique world striving to crack those oracular nuts from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Delphi, Ammon, and elsewhere, in only one of which can I
so much as surmise that any kernel had ever lodged; that,
namely, wherein Apollo confessed that he was mortal. One
Didymus is, moreover, related to have written six thousand
books on the single subject of grammar, a topic rendered only
more tenebrific by the labours of his successors, and which
seems still to possess an attraction for authors in proportion
as they can make nothing of it. A singular loadstone for
theologians, also, is the Beast in the Apocalypse, whereof, in
the course of my studies, I have noted two hundred and three
several interpretations, each lethiferal to all the rest. <i>Non
nostrum est tantas componere lites</i>, yet I have myself ventured
upon a two hundred and fourth, which I embodied in a discourse
preached on occasion of the demise of the late usurper,
Napoleon Bonaparte, and which quieted, in a large measure,
the minds of my people. It is true that my views on this important
point were ardently controverted by Mr. Shearjashub
Holden, the then preceptor of our academy, and in other particulars
a very deserving and sensible young man, though possessing
a somewhat limited knowledge of the Greek tongue.
But his heresy struck down no deep root, and, he having been
lately removed by the hand of Providence, I had the satisfaction
of re-affirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached
upon the Lord's-day immediately succeeding his funeral. This
might seem like taking an unfair advantage, did I not add that
he had made provision in his last will (being celibate) for the
publication of a posthumous tractate in support of his own
dangerous opinions.</p>

<p>I know of nothing in our modern times which approaches
so nearly to the ancient oracle as the letter of a Presidential
candidate. Now, among the Greeks, the eating of beans was
strictly forbidden to all such as had it in mind to consult those
expert amphibologists, and this same prohibition on the part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of Pythagoras to his disciples is understood to imply an abstinence
from politics, beans having been used as ballots. That
other explication, <i>quod videlicet sensus eo cibo obtundi existimaret</i>,
though supported <i>pugnis et calcibus</i> by many of the
learned, and not wanting the countenance of Cicero, is confuted
by the larger experience of New England. On the
whole, I think it safer to apply here the rule of interpretation
which now generally obtains in regard to antique cosmogonies,
myths, fables, proverbial expressions, and knotty points generally,
which is, to find a common-sense meaning, and then
select whatever can be imagined the most opposite thereto.
In this way we arrive at the conclusion, that the Greeks objected
to the questioning of candidates. And very properly,
if, as I conceive, the chief point be not to discover what a person
in that position is, or what he will do, but whether he can
be elected. <i>Vos exemplaria Gr&aelig;ca nocturna versate manu, versate
diurna.</i></p>

<p>But, since an imitation of the Greeks in this particular (the
asking of questions being one chief privilege of freemen) is
hardly to be hoped for, and our candidates will answer, whether
they are questioned or not, I would recommend that these
ante-electionary dialogues should be carried on by symbols, as
were the diplomatic correspondences of the Scythians and
Macrobii, or confined to the language of signs, like the famous
interview of Panurge and Goatsnose. A candidate might then
convey a suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing
one eye, or by presenting them with a phial of Egyptian darkness
to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies.
These answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective
construction the exigencies of the political campaign might
seem to demand, and the candidate could take his position on
either side of the fence with entire consistency. Or, if letters
must be written, profitable use might be made of the Dighton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script, every fresh decipherer
of which is enabled to educe a different meaning, whereby a
sculptured stone or two supplies us, and will probably continue
to supply posterity, with a very vast and various body of authentic
history. For even the briefest epistle in the ordinary
chirography is dangerous. There is scarce any style so compressed
that superfluous words may not be detected in it. A
severe critic might curtail that famous brevity of C&aelig;sar's by
two thirds, drawing his pen through the supererogatory <i>veni</i>
and <i>vidi</i>. Perhaps, after all, the surest footing of hope is to
be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and
less of qualification in candidates. Already have statesmanship,
experience, and the possession (nay, the profession, even)
of principles been rejected as superfluous, and may not the
patriot reasonably hope that the ability to write will follow?
At present, there may be death in pot-hooks as well as pots,
the loop of a letter may suffice for a bow-string, and all the
dreadful heresies of Anti-slavery may lurk in a flourish.&mdash;H. W.]</p>

<h3>A SECOND LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.</h3>



<div class="hw"><p>[In the following epistle, we behold Mr. Sawin returning a
<i>miles emeritus</i>, to the bosom of his family. <i>Quantum mutatus!</i>
The good Father of us all had doubtless entrusted to the keeping
of this child of his certain faculties of a constructive kind.
He had put in him a share of that vital force, the nicest economy
of every minute atom of which is necessary to the perfect
development of Humanity. He had given him a brain and
heart, and so had equipped his soul with the two strong wings
of knowledge and love, whereby it can mount to hang its nest
under the eaves of heaven. And this child, so dowered, he
had entrusted to the keeping of his vicar, the State. How
stands the account of that stewardship? The State, or Society
(call her by what name you will), had taken no manner
of thought of him till she saw him swept out into the street,
the pitiful leavings of last night's debauch, with cigar-ends,
lemon-parings, tobacco-quids, slops, vile stenches, and the
whole loathsome next-morning of the bar-room,&mdash;an own child
of the Almighty God! I remember him as he was brought to
be christened, a ruddy, rugged babe; and now there he wallows,
reeking, seething,&mdash;the dead corpse, not of a man, but of a
soul,&mdash;a putrefying lump, horrible for the life that is in it.
Comes the wind of heaven, that good Samaritan, and parts the
hair upon his forehead, nor is too nice to kiss those parched,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
cracked lips; the morning opens upon him her eyes full of
pitying sunshine, the sky yearns down to him,&mdash;and there he
lies fermenting. O sleep! let me not profane thy holy name
by calling that stertorous unconsciousness a slumber! By and
by comes along the State, God's vicar. Does she say,&mdash;"My
poor, forlorn foster-child! Behold here a force which I will
make dig and plant and build for me"? Not so, but,&mdash;"Here
is a recruit ready-made to my hand, a piece of destroying
energy lying unprofitably idle." So she claps an ugly grey
suit on him, puts a musket in his grasp, and sends him off,
with Gubernatorial and other godspeeds, to do duty as a
destroyer.</p>

<p>I made one of the crowd at the last Mechanics' Fair, and,
with the rest, stood gazing in wonder at a perfect machine,
with its soul of fire, its boiler-heart that sent the hot blood
pulsing along the iron arteries, and its thews of steel. And
while I was admiring the adaptation of means to end, the harmonious
involutions of contrivance, and the never-bewildered
complexity, I saw a grimed and greasy fellow, the imperious
engine's lackey and drudge, whose sole office was to let fall,
at intervals, a drop or two of oil upon a certain joint. Then
my soul said within me, See there a piece of mechanism to
which that other you marvel at is but as the rude first effort
of a child,&mdash;a force which not merely suffices to set a few
wheels in motion, but which can send an impulse all through
the infinite future,&mdash;a contrivance, not for turning out pins,
or stitching button-holes, but for making Hamlets and Lears.
And yet this thing of iron shall be housed, waited on, guarded
from rust and dust, and it shall be a crime but so much as to
scratch it with a pin; while the other, with its fire of God in
it, shall be buffeted hither and thither, and finally sent carefully
a thousand miles to be the target for a Mexican cannon-ball.
Unthrifty Mother State! My heart burned within me for pity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and indignation, and I renewed this covenant with my own
soul,&mdash;<i>In aliis mansuetus ero, at, in blasphemiis contra Christum,
non ita.</i>&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>

<div class="hw"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>It would appear that Mr. Sawin found the actual feast
curiously the reverse of the bill of fare advertised in Faneuil
Hall and other places. His primary object seems to have
been the making of his fortune. <i>Qu&aelig;renda pecunia primum,
virtus post nummos.</i> He hoisted sail for Eldorado, and shipwrecked
on Point Tribulation. <i>Quid non mortalia pectora
cogis, auri sacra fames?</i> The speculation has sometimes
crossed my mind, in that dreary interval of drought which
intervenes between quarterly stipendiary showers, that Providence,
by the creation of a money-tree, might have simplified
wonderfully the sometimes perplexing problem of human life.
We read of bread-trees, the butter for which lies ready-churned
in Irish bogs. Milk-trees we are assured of in South
America, and stout Sir John Hawkins testifies to water-trees
in the Canaries. Boot-trees bear abundantly in Lynn and
elsewhere; and I have seen, in the entries of the wealthy, hat-trees
with a fair show of fruit. A family-tree I once cultivated
myself, and found therefrom but a scanty yield, and that
quite tasteless and innutritious. Of trees bearing men we are
not without examples; as those in the park of Louis the
Eleventh of France. Who has forgotten, moreover, that
olive-tree growing in the Athenian's back-garden, with its
strange uxorious crop, for the general propagation of which,
as of a new and precious variety, the philosopher Diogenes,
hitherto uninterested in arboriculture, was so zealous? In
the <i>sylva</i> of our own Southern States, the females of my family
have called my attention to the china-tree. Not to multiply
examples, I will barely add to my list the birch-tree, in the
smaller branches of which has been implanted so miraculous
a virtue for communicating the Latin and Greek languages,
and which may well therefore be classed among the trees
producing necessaries of life,&mdash;<i>venerabile donum fatalis virg&aelig;</i>.
That money-trees existed in the golden age there want not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
prevalent reasons for our believing. For does not the old
proverb, when it asserts that money does not grow on <i>every</i>
bush, imply <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, that there were certain bushes which
did produce it? Again, there is another ancient saw to the
effect that money is the <i>root</i> of all evil. From which two
adages it may be safe to infer that the aforesaid species of tree
first degenerated into a shrub, then absconded underground,
and finally, in our iron age, vanished altogether. In favourable
exposures it may be conjectured that a specimen or two survived
to a great age, as in the garden of the Hesperides; and,
indeed, what else could that tree in the Sixth &AElig;neid have
been, with a branch whereof the Trojan hero procured admission
to a territory, for the entering of which money is a
surer passport than to a certain other more profitable (too)
foreign kingdom? Whether these speculations of mine have
any force in them, or whether they will not rather, by most
readers, be deemed impertinent to the matter in hand, is a
question which I leave to the determination of an indulgent
posterity. That there were, in more primitive and happier
times, shops where money was sold,&mdash;and that, too, on credit
and at a bargain,&mdash;I take to be matter of demonstration. For
what but a dealer in this article was that &AElig;olus who supplied
Ulysses with motive power for his fleet in bags? What that
Ericus, king of Sweden, who is said to have kept the winds in
his cap? What, in more recent times, those Lapland Nornas
who traded in favourable breezes? All which will appear the
more clearly when we consider, that, even to this day, <i>raising
the wind</i> is proverbial for raising money, and that brokers and
banks were invented by the Venetians at a later period.</p>

<p>And now for the improvement of this digression. I find a
parallel to Mr. Sawin's fortune in an adventure of my own.
For, shortly after I had first broached to myself the before-stated
natural-historical and arch&aelig;ological theories, as I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
passing, <i>h&aelig;c negotia penitus mecum revolvens</i>, through one
of the obscure suburbs of our New England metropolis, my
eye was attracted by these words upon a sign-board,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cheap
Cash-Store</span>. Here was at once the confirmation of my speculations,
and the substance of my hopes. Here lingered the
fragment of a happier past, or stretched out the first tremulous
organic filament of a more fortunate future. Thus glowed the
distant Mexico to the eyes of Sawin, as he looked through the
dirty pane of the recruiting-office window, or speculated from
the summit of that mirage-Pisgah which the imps of the bottle
are so cunning in raising up. Already had my Alnaschar-fancy
(even during that first half-believing glance) expended in various
useful directions the funds to be obtained by pledging
the manuscript of a proposed volume of discourses. Already
did a clock ornament the tower of the Jaalam meeting-house&mdash;a
gift appropriately, but modestly, commemorated in the parish
and town records, both, for now many years, kept by myself.
Already had my son Seneca completed his course at the University.
Whether, for the moment, we may not be considered
as actually lording it over those Baratarias with the viceroyalty
of which Hope invests us, and whether we are ever so warmly
housed as in our Spanish castles, would afford matter of argument.
Enough that I found that sign-board to be no other
than a bait to the trap of a decayed grocer. Nevertheless, I
bought a pound of dates (getting short weight by reason of
immense flights of harpy flies, who pursued and lighted upon
their prey even in the very scales), which purchase I made,
not only with an eye to the little ones at home, but also as a
figurative reproof of that too-frequent habit of my mind, which,
forgetting the due order of chronology, will often persuade me
that the happy sceptre of Saturn is stretched over this Astr&aelig;a-forsaken
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Having glanced at the ledger of Glory under the title<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<i>Sawin, B.</i>, let us extend our investigations, and discover if that
instructive volume does not contain some charges more personally
interesting to ourselves. I think we should be more
economical of our resources, did we thoroughly appreciate the
fact, that, whenever Brother Jonathan seems to be thrusting
his hand into his own pocket, he is, in fact, picking ours. I
confess that the late <i>muck</i> which the country has been running,
has materially changed my views as to the best method of
raising revenue. If, by means of direct taxation, the bills for
every extraordinary outlay were brought under our immediate
eye, so that, like thrifty housekeepers, we could see where and
how fast the money was going, we should be less likely to
commit extravagances. At present, these things are managed
in such a hugger-mugger way, that we know not what we pay
for; the poor man is charged as much as the rich; and, while
we are saving and scrimping at the spigot, the government is
drawing off at the bung. If we could know that a part of the
money we expend for tea and coffee goes to buy powder and
ball, and that it is Mexican blood which makes the clothes on
our backs more costly, it would set some of us athinking.
During the present fall, I have often pictured to myself a
government official entering my study, and handing me the
following bill:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="hw"><p>I can fancy the official answering my look of horror with,&mdash;"Yes,
Sir, it looks like a high charge, Sir; but in these days
slaughtering is slaughtering." Verily, I would that every one
understood that it was; for it goes about obtaining money
under the false pretence of being glory. For me, I have an
imagination which plays me uncomfortable tricks. It happens
to me sometimes to see a slaughterer on his way home from
his day's work, and forthwith my imagination puts a cocked-hat
upon his head, and epaulettes upon his shoulders, and sets
him up as a candidate for the Presidency. So, also, on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
recent public occasion, as the place assigned to the "Reverend
Clergy" is just behind that of "Officers of the Army and
Navy" in processions, it was my fortune to be seated at the
dinner-table over against one of these respectable persons.
He was arrayed as (out of his own profession) only kings,
court-officers, and footmen are in Europe, and Indians in America.
Now what does my over-officious imagination but set to
work upon him, strip him of his gay livery, and present him
to me coatless, his trousers thrust into the tops of a pair of
boots thick with clotted blood, and a basket on his arm out of
which lolled a gore-smeared axe, thereby destroying my relish
for the temporal mercies upon the board before me.&mdash;H. W.]</p>

<h3>A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN, ESQ.</h3>



<div class="hw"><p>[Upon the following letter slender comment will be needful.
In what river Selemnus has Mr. Sawin bathed, that he has
become so swiftly oblivious of his former loves? From an
ardent and (as befits a soldier) confident wooer of that coy
bride, the popular favour, we see him subside of a sudden into
the (I trust not jilted) Cincinnatus, returning to his plough
with a goodly-sized branch of willow in his hand; figuratively
returning, however, to a figurative plough, and from no profound
affection for that honoured implement of husbandry (for which,
indeed, Mr. Sawin never displayed any decided predilection),
but in order to be gracefully summoned therefrom to more
congenial labours. It would seem that the character of the
ancient Dictator had become part of the recognised stock of
our modern political comedy, though, as our term of office
extends to a quadrennial length, the parallel is not so minutely
exact as could be desired. It is sufficiently so, however, for
purposes of scenic representation. An humble cottage (if
built of logs, the better) forms the Arcadian background of the
stage. This rustic paradise is labeled Ashland, Jaalam, North
Bend, Marshfield, Kinderhook, or B&acirc;ton Rouge, as occasion
demands. Before the door stands a something with one handle
(the other painted in proper perspective), which represents, in
happy ideal vagueness, the plough. To this the defeated candidate
rushes with delirious joy, welcomed as a father by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
appropriate groups of happy labourers, or from it the successful
one is torn with difficulty, sustained alone by a noble sense
of public duty. Only I have observed, that, if the scene be
laid at B&acirc;ton Rouge or Ashland, the labourers are kept carefully
in the background, and are heard to shout from behind
the scenes in a singular tone, resembling ululation, and accompanied
by a sound not unlike vigorous clapping. This, however,
may be artistically in keeping with the habits of the rustic
population of those localities. The precise connexion between
agricultural pursuits and statesmanship I have not been able,
after diligent inquiry, to discover. But, that my investigations
may not be barren of all fruit, I will mention one curious statistical
fact, which I consider thoroughly established, namely,
that no real farmer ever attains practically beyond a seat in
General Court, however theoretically qualified for more exalted
station.</p>

<p>It is probable that some other prospect has been opened to
Mr. Sawin, and that he has not made this great sacrifice without
some definite understanding in regard to a seat in the
cabinet, or a foreign mission. It may be supposed that we of
Jaalam were not untouched by a feeling of villatic pride in
beholding our townsman occupying so large a space in the
public eye. And to me, deeply revolving the qualifications
necessary to a candidate in these frugal times, those of Mr. S.
seemed peculiarly adapted to a successful campaign. The loss
of a leg, an arm, an eye, and four fingers, reduced him so
nearly to the condition of a <i>vox et pr&aelig;terea nihil</i>, that I could
think of nothing but the loss of his head by which his chance
could have been bettered. But since he has chosen to baulk
our suffrages, we must content ourselves with what we can
get, remembering <i>lactucas non esse dandas, dum cardui sufficiant</i>.&mdash;H. W.]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="hw"><p>[Here, patient reader, we take leave of each other, I trust
with some mutual satisfaction. I say <i>patient</i>, for I love not
that kind which skims dippingly over the surface of the page,
as swallows over a pool before rain. By such no pearls shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
be gathered. But if no pearls there be (as, indeed, the world
is not without example of books wherefrom the longest-winded
diver shall bring up no more than his proper handful
of mud), yet let us hope that an oyster or two may reward
adequate perseverance. If neither pearls nor oysters, yet is
patience itself a gem worth diving deeply for.</p>

<p>It may seem to some that too much space has been usurped
by my own private lucubrations, and some may be fain to
bring against me that old jest of him who preached all his
hearers out of the meeting-house save only the sexton, who,
remaining for yet a little space, from a sense of official duty, at
last gave out also, and, presenting the keys, humbly requested
our preacher to lock the doors, when he should have wholly
relieved himself of his testimony. I confess to a satisfaction
in the self act of preaching, nor do I esteem a discourse to be
wholly thrown away even upon a sleeping or unintelligent
auditory. I cannot easily believe that the Gospel of St. John,
which Jacques Cartier ordered to be read in the Latin tongue
to the Canadian savages, upon his first meeting with them,
fell altogether upon stony ground. For the earnestness of the
preacher is a sermon appreciable by dullest intellects and most
alien ears. In this wise did Episcopius convert many to his
opinions, who yet understood not the language in which he
discoursed. The chief thing is, that the messenger believe
that he has an authentic message to deliver. For counterfeit
messengers that mode of treatment which Father John de
Plano Carpini relates to have prevailed among the Tartars
would seem effectual, and, perhaps, deserved enough. For
my own part, I may lay claim to so much of the spirit of
martyrdom as would have led me to go into banishment with
those clergymen whom Alphonso the Sixth of Portugal drave
out of his kingdom for refusing to shorten their pulpit eloquence.
It is possible, that, having been invited into my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
brother Biglow's desk, I may have been too little scrupulous
in using it for the venting of my own peculiar doctrines to a
congregation drawn together in the expectation and with the
desire of hearing him.</p>

<p>I am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental organization
which impels me, like the railroad-engine with its
train of cars, to run backward for a short distance in order
to obtain a fairer start. I may compare myself to one fishing
from the rocks when the sea runs high, who, misinterpreting
the suction of the undertow for the biting of some larger fish,
jerks suddenly, and finds that he has <i>caught bottom</i>, hauling
in upon the end of his line a trail of various <i>alg&aelig;</i>, among
which, nevertheless, the naturalist may haply find somewhat
to repay the disappointment of the angler. Yet have I conscientiously
endeavoured to adapt myself to the impatient
temper of the age, daily degenerating more and more from the
high standard of our pristine New England. To the catalogue
of lost arts I would mournfully add also that of listening
to two-hour sermons. Surely we have been abridged into a
race of pigmies. For, truly, in those of the old discourses
yet subsisting to us in print, the endless spinal column of
divisions and subdivisions can be likened to nothing so exactly
as to the vertebr&aelig; of the saurians, whence the theorist may
conjecture a race of Anakim proportionate to the withstanding
of these other monsters. I say Anakim rather than Nephelim,
because there seem reasons for supposing that the race
of those whose heads (though no giants) are constantly enveloped
in clouds (which that name imports) will never become
extinct. The attempt to vanquish the innumerable
<i>heads</i> of one of those aforementioned discourses may supply
us with a plausible interpretation of the second labour of Hercules,
and his successful experiment with fire affords us a
useful precedent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>But while I lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard,
I cannot refuse to succumb to its influence. Looking out
through my study-window, I see Mr. Biglow at a distance
busy in gathering his Baldwins, of which, to judge by the
number of barrels lying about under the trees, his crop is
more abundant than my own,&mdash;by which sight I am admonished
to turn to those orchards of the mind wherein my
labours may be more prospered, and apply myself diligently to
the preparation of my next Sabbath's discourse.&mdash;H. W.]</p></div>
